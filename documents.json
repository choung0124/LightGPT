This study was conducted to determine the role of fundus photography as a\nnoninvasive and readily available tool for assessing neurologic dysfunction among patients\nwith PD using deep learningmethods.\nOBJECTIVE To develop an algorithm that can predict Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale and Unified\nParkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score using fundus photography among\npatients with PD.\nDESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Thiswas a prospective decision analytical model\nconducted at a single tertiary-care hospital. The fundus photographs of participants with PD\nand participants with non-PD atypical motor abnormalities who visited the neurology\ndepartment of Kangbuk Samsung Hospital from October 7, 2020, to April 30, 2021, were\nanalyzed in this study. A convolutional neural network was developed to predict both the H-Y\nscale and UPDRS-III score based on fundus photography findings and participants\u2019\ndemographic characteristics.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUROC) was calculated for sensitivity and specificity analyses for both the internal and\nexternal validation data sets.\nRESULTS A total of 615 participants were included in the study: 266 had PD (43.3%; mean\n[SD] age, 70.8 [8.3] years; 134 male individuals [50.4%]), and 349 had non-PD atypical motor\nabnormalities (56.7%; mean [SD] age, 70.7 [7.9] years; 236 female individuals [67.6%]).

In general, we agree it is possible\nto diagnose PD without any brain imaging or laboratory tests.\nHowever, it is also sometimes necessary to rule out other possible\ndiseases.For example, brain magnetic resonance imaging\nis essential to rule out vascular parkinsonism, which tends to arise\nin geographic regions with a high prevalence of cerebral small vessel\ndisease and white matter hyperintensities (eg, Asian\ncountries).2 Indeed, there are studies that have shown that brain\nmagnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography examinations\nare required to rule out differential diagnoses\nand to have a more definitive diagnosis of PD.3\nOur team attempted to objectively evaluate changes in the\nretinal images of patients with PD using artificial intelligence;\nour goal was to present a simple and feasible diagnosis\nof early-stage PD. To diagnose PD accurately, nortropane positron\nemission tomography scanning using nuclear medicine\nisotopes has been established as an essential test,4 which is\nwidely used in Korea.\nFurthermore, Dr Hamedani noted that the 2 measures of\nPD severity used in this study are quite simple. We wish to\nclarify that we are not advocating that physical examinations\ncould be substituted for Hoehn and Yahr stage and Unified\nParkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale scores with fundus photography.\nThe purpose of our study1 was to determine whether\ndeep-learning methods can provide information that the retina\ncan reflect cognitive functional changes in the brain. Although\nthere have been previously published studies about retinal changes in PD,5 the associations were inconsistent and\nthe studies were based on less accessible and more expensive\nexaminations, such as optical coherence tomography. Our\nstudy has shown that by using deep-learning methods on fundus\nphotography, the retina can provide objective information\nregarding neurofunctional changes in patients with PD.\nAdditionally, we believe there are possible clinical applications\nwith the maturing of deep-learning technology. Fundus\nphotography is already used for diabetic retinopathy\nscreening in many countries, often performed by optometrists\nor general practitioners. These health professionals will\nnot be expected to diagnose or screen for PD in their normal\nwork. In Korea, fundus photography is also included in the\nannual health screening for individuals older than 40 years.\nSo, there is potential for fundus photography as an opportunistic\nscreening tool for PD and other systemic diseases.6\nWon Tae Yoon, MD, PhD\nSu Jeong Song, MD, PhD\nJitae Shin, PhD", "metadata": {"name": "Deep Learning, the Retina, and Parkinson Disease", "page": 2, "pdf_id": "d632f53d-16aa-4d0b-b227-350055d6609c"}, "id": "10"}, {"document": "Figure 2.

Experimental Protocol. The experiment was\nconducted at the Hybrid Device-Based Circadian ICT\nResearch Center (C-ICT), Kookmin University, from January\n2019 to December 2019. One week prior to the start of the\nstudy, the participants were instructed to maintain their\nhabitual sleep\u2212wake pattern. This study was conducted with\none participant at a time in two 50 h sets (conventional\nlighting and HCL) in a temperature and relative humidity\ncontrolled clinical laboratory, as shown in Figure 1. In\nparticular, in this study, the constant routine (CR) protocol,\nwhich includes the time-consuming dim light condition, was\nintentionally excluded to make light-induced melatonin control\nmore accessible to those interested. All participants were\nexposed to both types of lighting with an interval of 1 week,\nand the first type of lighting was randomly assigned to each\nparticipant (half of all participants started with conventional\nlighting). The participants arrived at the experimental chamber\nbefore 10:00 on the first day and were exposed to both daytime\nand nighttime lighting conditions. Both daytime and nighttime\nlighting conditions were controlled, as the timelines required\ndifferent roles for melatonin. After 8 h of sleep in darkness,\nparticipants woke up at 08:00 and followed a full day\u2019s\nschedule and left at 12:00 on the third day after being exposed\nto the daytime light condition from 08:00 to 12:00. Because\nthe participants were exposed to different light in their own\nspace prior to admission, they spent time adapting to the\ndesigned lighting on the first day to minimize the effects of this\nlight. There were no restrictions on their behavior when\nstaying inside the laboratory. Electronic video devices such as a\ncomputer or smartphone could be used with application of a\nblue light filter, but the device use was restricted from 18:00\nuntil bedtime. All meals were served at the same times (08:00,\n13:00, and 18:00) and were the same food type. During the\napplication of each experimental condition, saliva samples were\ncollected 15 times to measure melatonin levels depending on\nlighting. Melatonin samples were collected every 2 h from\n12:00 to 20:00, every hour from 20:00 to 03:00 on the second\nday, and every 2 h from 08:00 to 12:00 on the third day. The\nStanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) was administered at 11:00 on\nthe first day and third day to assess the subjective sleepiness of\nthe participants.30 The study was conducted according to the\nguidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study\nprotocols were approved by the Kookmin University Institutional\nReview Board (KMU-201904-HR-203).\n2.4.

Five well-known\nCNNs (ResNet-18, ResNet-101, VGG19, EfficientNet-b0, and\nEfficientNEt-b7)were used based only on the fundus images.\nAs shown in the eTable in Supplement 1, the CNNs successfully\ndiscriminated between the groupswith andwithout PD.\nResNet-18, in particular, achieved the best performance,with\na sensitivity of 77.05%(95%CI, 74.93%-79.18%), a specificity\nof 76.46 (95%CI, 74.75%-78.18%), an AUROC of 0.76 (95%CI,\n0.74-0.78), and an accuracy of 76.75% (95% CI, 75.51%-\n77.99%) (eTable in Supplement 1). Therefore, we used the\nResNet-18 as a baseline network for building our deep learning\nsystem.\nSeverity Classification Performance With Clinical Data\nin the Validation Data Set\nAmultimodalitymethodwasused to accurately classify the severity\nofsymptomsandmotorfunction ofpatientswithPDusing\ntheH-YscaleandUPDRS-IIIscorewhenusedinconjunctionwith\nfundus images and clinical data. For this experiment, we constructed\nthe following 4 models: model 1, fundus images only;\nmodel 2, fundus images with sex and age data; model 3, fundus\nimageswith sex, age, diabetes, andhypertension data; and\nmodel 4, fundus imageswith sex, age, diabetes, and hypertension\ndata along with a multimodal method. The multimodal\nmethodis presentedinFigure 2.Thefourthmodelachieved the\nbest performance,with a sensitivity of83.23%(95%CI, 82.07%-\n84.38%), a specificity of 66.81%(95%CI, 64.97%-68.65%), an\nAUROC of 0.77 (95%CI, 0.75-0.79), and an accuracy of 73.38%\n(95%CI, 71.55%-75.21%)for the H-Yscale (Table 2).ForUPDRSIII,\nthe fourthmodeldemonstrateda sensitivity of 82.61%(95%\nCI, 81.38%-83.83%), a specificity of 65.75% (95% CI, 62.56%-\n68.94%), an AUROC of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75-0.79), and an accuracy\nof 73.38%(95%CI, 71.55%-75.21%) (Table 3).\nSeverity Classification Performance in the External Testing Data Set\nIn the external testing data set,we collected sex and age information\nalongwith the fundus imagewithH-Y scale of patients\nfrom Yeungnam University Hospital and Seoul National UniversityHospital.\nBecause only 2 clinical data points, ie, sex and\nage information,were available from the external data set,we\nbuilt a deep learning systembyusing the fourth method, which\nused fundus images and 2 clinical data points along with the\nmultimodal method. The deep learning system discriminated\nthe H-Y scale with a sensitivity of 80.32% (95% CI, 79.07%-\n81.56%), a specificity of 61.44% (95% CI, 58.02%-64.87%), an\nAUROC of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.70%-0.75%), and an accuracy of\n65.42% (95%CI, 64.21%-66.62%) for the validation data set. A\nsensitivity of 70.73% (95%CI, 66.30%-75.16%), a specificity of\n66.66%(95%CI, 50.76%-82.25%), an AUROC of 0.67 (95%CI,\n0.55-0.79), and an accuracy of 70.45% (95% CI, 66.85%-\n74.04%) were obtained for the external testing data set.\nDiscussion\nPredicting cognitive impairment among patients with PD is\ncrucial not only for diagnostic purposes but also for risk", "metadata": {"name": "Neurologic Dysfunction Assessment in Parkinson Disease Based on Fundus Photographs Using Deep Learning", "page": 4, "pdf_id": "6971845f-ea5b-4da2-8300-c0e640223994"}, "id": "4"}, {"document": "Table 4: Sex differences in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held in LD conditions.\nComparisons of age-matched male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held in LD.

Therefore, besides the established diagnostic\nmethod, many studies have been conducted to investigate\nthe potential metrics for PD, translating these into\nclinically practical tools for the diagnosis and treatment of\npatients with PD.\nThe unique features of the retina make it a useful\nassessment tool for various systemic diseases. First, the\nretina is the only organ in which blood vessels can be examined\nnoninvasively. Recently, in addition to predicting biometric\ndata associated with cardiovascular risks, attempts\nto assess the direct cardiovascular disease risk by predicting\nthe coronary calcium score based on fundus photographs\nhave been made by several studies; these attempts have\nyielded encouraging results.3-7 Cho et al7 reported predicting\ncoronary calcium score based on the fundus photographs\nwith other biometrics showing an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.757\n(95% CI, 0.73-0.79). Second, due to a common embryonic\norigin, the brain and retina share many biological features\nthat play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of major neurodegenerative\ndiseases, including PD.8-18 Recent studies\nhave reported that PD progression is associated with the\nstructural changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer and suggest\nthe potential role of the retina as a modality for assessing\nPD progression.16-21 Recently, deep learning algorithms\nhave been used in several medical fields. Even though deep\nlearning algorithms are considered black box learning methods\n(ie, the machine learning model provides a result without\nexplaining how that result was derived), these algorithms\npermit clinicians to seek new associations and\nfindings that are beyond the extent of traditional analytic\nmethods and human participants.1-5 The application of various\ndeep learning methods to predict cardiovascular disease\nrisks or systemic biometric values using fundus photography\nis already well known.6,7 Given the strong anatomic\nassociation between the retina and PD, it is natural for\nresearchers of PD to study the possible role of fundus photographs\nusing the Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scale and Unified\nParkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) evaluation\nmetric. Therefore, in this prospective study, we developed\na deep learning algorithm to predict both the H-Y scale\nand UPDRS-III score using fundus photography among\npatients with PD.

Benke, PhD\nThe deep learning (DL) approach is a recent development in\nresearch on the automation of medical diagnostics using machine\nlearning. This type of statistical learning is not based on\nbiophysical (mechanistic) models but on training (for parameter\nestimation) using a\nsample of population data.\nThere are issues about robustness\nin performance when testing on new data sets in uncontrolled\nconditions separate fromvalidation experiments. The\nuse ofDLin diagnostic modeling has been demonstrated in recent\nyearswith very encouraging results in the assessment of\ndiabetic retinopathy, geographic atrophy in age-relatedmacular\ndegeneration, and cardiovascular disease when using images\nof the retina.1\nThe study by Ahn et al1 in this issue of JAMAOphthalmology\nprovides insights and useful information on the application\nof DL to explore possible associations between changes\nin the retina and brain function. The reported work is interesting\nas it explores the use of DL approaches for assessment\nof cognitive function scores for disease severity in the case of\nParkinson disease (PD), which is projected to be an increasing\neconomic burden.2 In the study, fundus photographswere collected\nfrom615 participantswhowere outpatients at the neurology\ndepartment of Kangbuk SamsungHospital in SouthKorea\n(August2020toApril 2021).Tocompensate for the typically\nsmall sample sizes often encountered in ophthalmology research,\nthe authors applied a range of image augmentation\ntechniques, which included random rotation and random flip,\nto increase the sample size.\nFive common convolutional neural network (CNN) modelswere\ninvestigatedto predict theHoehn andYahr Scale (H-Y)\nand Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS)\nscores for PD,3,4 with the training based on fundus photographs\nand patient demographic characteristics. The study\nechoed other works that have investigated the idea that\nchanges manifestedin the retinamayprovide indicators of neurological\nimpairment due to PD.5 The prospective casecontrol\nhospital-based study revealed that, for the internal validation\ndata, theDLsystemhad high sensitivity that was above\n80%for both theH\u2013YandUPDRS scores.Thespecificity ranged\nfrom 66% to 67% for H-Y and UPDRS scores. For the external\nvalidation data, the sensitivity and specificitywere 70.73%and\n66.66%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic\ncurve was 0.67 and accuracy was 70.5%.\nAnadvantageof thismethodfor severity assessment is that\nit is noninvasive and based on readily available fundus retina\nimages, rather than using images of the brain, such as radiological\nimages like computed tomography and magnetic resonance\nimaging scans. Comparatively, these images are a little\nmore invasive and time consuming in their acquisition.Anadditional\nsalient feature of this study was that it suggests the\npossibility of augmenting or even eventually replacing the 2\nstandard tests for severity of PD dysfunction, which are rating\nscales with a subjective component, with a more objective\napproach that reduces risk and uncertainty in diagnosis\nand therefore improves reliability. An approach based on DL\nmay be used as a fast screening method for cognitive impairment\nduring routine eye examinations. A feature of the diagnostic\nmethod is that finding an association between the algorithm\nprediction and the results for the 2 standard tests\nprovides a degree of \u201cexplainability.\u201d This is because the DL\nalgorithm used to develop the predictive model produces results\nthat are associatedwith a disease severity scale. Furthermore,\nthe study revealed that the CNN uses the macular area\nfor finding associationswith PD cognitive impairment, as was\ndemonstrated using the class activation map (CAM)\u2014a heatmap-\nbased feature visualization tool. CAM is useful for explainability,\ngiven it highlights the regions of interests and the\ndegree of importance of these regions as estimated by the\nCNN.6\nTo create a CAM, a DL architecture must apply global average\npooling (GAP) to the final convolutional feature maps.\nThe GAP will be followed by a layer, fully connected, designed\nto produce the predictions. While this study has used\nCAM,a limitation of this approach is thatCNNsthatdonot have\nthe GAP layer cannot take advantage of CAM-based visualization.\nTo solve this problem, Grad-CAMhas been designed as a\ngeneralization of CAM. While the CAM weights features are\nbased on the final fully connected layer, Grad-CAM is not an\narchitecture-dependent method but creates an importance\nscore based on the gradients of any trained CNN (which is a\nform of post hoc attention, meaning that it is a method that\nproduces heatmaps from an already trained neural network).\nThe idea is to exploit the spatial information that is preserved\nby the convolution layers and to understand which parts of an\ninput image were important for a classification decision.\nWhile a stepping stone above CAM, Grad-CAM does have\nits own disadvantages. For example, it cannot locate objects\nin instances where an image has multiple occurrences of the\nsame class. Another consequence is that the localization often\ndoes not correspond to the whole object, but to parts of it.\nTo overcome this problem, GradCAM++ and its variantXGrad-\nCAMwere designed,with the former using second-order gradients\nto obtain activations that are independent of the object\nsize, and the latter scaling the gradients by the normalized\nactivation maps.7 Thus, in this study, the results and application\nof DL, aswell as explainable steps, are encouraging.However,\nthere needs to be further consolidation in future experiments\nto establish the potential of this fast, noninvasive tool\nfor routine applications in a clinical context as well as indepth\nanalysis to verify the explainable features as deter-", "metadata": {"name": "Deep Learning Using Images of the Retina for Assessment of Severity of Neurological Dysfunction in Parkinson Disease", "page": 1, "pdf_id": "f261c5b7-512c-4ac9-bc94-dc99607befa7"}, "id": "7"}, {"document": "Running title: Decreasing light-dependent behavioral disruption\nHuei Bin Wang1,2,5, David Zhou2, Shu Hon Christopher Luk2, Hye In Cha2, Amanda Mac2, Rim Chae2, Anna Matynia3, Ben Harrison6, Sina Afshari6, Gene D.

Moreover, the enrolled participants were classified\ninto the following 3 groups according to the UPDRS-III\nscore: a control groupwith aUPDRS-III score of0; a groupwith\naUPDRS-III score of 1 to 14; and a groupwith aUPDRS-III score\nof 15 or greater.\nData Preprocessing\nTo evaluate the participants\u2019 stage based on the deep learning\nsystem with fundus images, we applied general imageaugmentation\ntechniques, which include random rotation and\nrandom flip, to train the deep learning system. To prevent a\npossible problemwith overfittingdueto a smallamount ofdata\nin the deep learning system,we additionally proposed a coloraugmentation\ntechnique that changes the background color\nof the fundus images that can be observed in the actual fundus\nimage (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Eventually, we generated\nthe fundus images with various background colors, increasing\nthe number of fundus images that could be used in\nthe deep learning system.\nDeep Learning System\nDeep learning is a machine learning technique that consists of\nmultilayeredartificial neuralnetworks(ANNs).Among the various\ntypes of ANNs, a convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts\nfeatures from images, which are input values, using a\nconvolutional filter. ACNNis particularly useful in using data\nto classify images by recognizing similar patterns. In other\nwords, manually extracting features is not necessary. Because\nof these advantages,CNNiswidely used in areas requiring\nobject recognition or computer vision to find meaningful\nfeatures from medical images.13-16,25\nTo establish a more accurate and discriminatory algorithm,\nwe conducted a multimodal network composed of a\nbaseline network based on a CNN and a fully-connected\nneural network. The purpose of this network was to\nimprove the ability to predict PD severity by achieving\nsynergy using both fundus images and clinical data\n(Figure 1).\nStatistical Analysis\nAmong the clinical data, the P value for age was obtained by\ncomparing the 2 groups (PD group vs non-PD group) through\na t test, whereas the P values of sex, diabetes, and hypertension\nwere obtained through a Pearson \u03c72 test. A 2-sided\nP value < .05 was considered statistically significant. To determine\nthe performance of our proposal, 4 metrics (sensitivity,\nspecificity, AUROC, and accuracy) were calculated in the\nvalidation data set for the classification of both H-Y scale and\nUPDRS-III score.26 Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity,\nAUROC, and accuracy were calculated in the external testing\ndata set for the classification of H-Y scale to show the accuracy\nof our proposal for the new sample data. The 4 metrics\nare widely used statistics for explaining a diagnostic test. In\nparticular, the proposed method is used to predict the presence\nor absence of PD, how well the classes of H-Y scale and\nUPDRS-III score are predicted, and to quantifyhowreliable the\nexperiment is.Bootstrapping was used to estimate the 95%CIs\nof the performance metrics with the participants as the resampling\nunit. All analyseswere performed using Python, version\n3.6 with Scikit-learn, version 0.24.2 and SciPy, version\n1.5.4 library metrics.26\nWe trained 5 well-known CNNs (ResNet-18, ResNet-101,\nVGG19, EfficientNet-b0, and EfficientNEt-b7) with binary\ncross-entropy loss function to verify that the normal and PD\nparticipant groups could be accurately distinguished by\nusing the sigmoid function in the last layer of each model.\nWe set the batch size to 32 and used the Adam optimizer;\nthe learning rate was set to 1e-4 with 150 epochs. After\nselecting the ResNet-18 as the baseline CNN from which to\nbuild a multimodal network (because our goal was to predict\nthe specific class of both the H-Y scale and UPDRS-III\nscore), we used the cross-entropy loss function for our multimodal\nnetwork with the softmax function in the last layer.\nWe reset the learning rate and epochs into 1e-5 and 500\nepochs, respectively.

While it is intriguing that a\ndeep-learning algorithm can predict the presence and severity\nof PD with 65% to 75% accuracy, the broader motivation\nand practical applications for this work are unclear.\nThe authors1 write that complex neurologic tests are\nrequired to diagnose PD, and therefore, new diagnostic tests\nare needed. This is true only insomuch as taking a history\nand performing a neurologic examination are considered\ncomplex. PD is a clinical diagnosis for which no imaging or\nlaboratory testing is required. Brain imaging is frequently\nincorporated into research studies but is not required for a\nclinical diagnosis according to diagnostic criteria from the\nInternational Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorder\nSociety,2 which have an accuracy of over 90%.3 Magnetic\nresonance imaging and I-123 single-photon emission computed\ntomography scans are occasionally used to distinguish\nPD from rarer causes of parkinsonism but are frequently not\nperformed4 and there is no role for magnetic resonance angiography\nin diagnosing PD.

It can be\ngleaned from watching someone walk down a hallway for 10\nseconds. The Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale is a\nstandardized neurologic examination that takes about 10\nminutes to perform.

This is additional evidence that\nthe VDA in plasmon-driven MJH is producing mechanical action\nthat is different than the action induced by light alone. The\nMJH without light activation has no effect on the area of the cell\nnor does DAPI enter the cell within the time window of the experiment\n(Figure S27, Supporting Information).

Lethal Concentration of Plasmon-Driven MJHs\nA clonogenic assay was conducted to confirm that cancer cells\ntreated by plasmon-driven MJH are killed upon NIR-light activation\n(Figure 6). Three molecules were tested: the most VDA active\nBL-204, the medium VDA active BL-141-2, and the low VDA\nactive Cy7-amine. The lethal concentration to kill the cell population\nby 50% (VDA IC50) was found to be 45, 65, and 175 nm,\nrespectively. The lethal concentrations to eradicate 100% of the\ncancer cells were 75, 100, and 500 nm, respectively. This result\nconfirms that BL-204 is one of the most active compounds in this\nlibrary to eradicate cancer cells. This was accomplished by incubating\nthe MJH molecules with the A375 cells for 50 min and\nthen activation of the plasmon-driven MJH using 730 nm NIRlight\nat 80 mW cm\u22122 for 10 min.\n2.9. Predicted Octanol\u2013Water Partition Coefficient (logP Value) in\nCyanine-Based MJH\nTo determine if the higher cell membrane permeabilization activity\nwas simply due to higher cell membrane affinity rather than\nthe EPI, we calculated the octanol\u2013water partition coefficient,\nlogP value, of the MJH using a logP calculator. This parameter\nindicates the lipophilicity of the MJH to the lipid bilayers.[40,41]\nThe higher the value the more likely the MJH will bind to the\nlipid bilayers. The protonation state of the MJH strongly influences\nthe polarity of the molecules and hence the logP values.\nThe logP values were calculated considering the charged state\n(amine protonated or carboxylic acid ionized) of the side chain\n(Figure S31A, Supporting Information) or in the neutral state\n(Figure S31B, Supporting Information) if no ionization was presumed.\nThe charged state is more likely to occur at pH \u22487.4 in\nthe medium since the pKa of the deprotonation of alkyl amines\nis \u22489.5\u201311 and of the ionization of the carboxylic acid is \u22485. The\nlogP values do not fully correlate with the ability to permeabilize\ncell membranes (Figure S31C,D, Supporting Information).\nThis supports the finding that the affinity of MJH to cell membranes\nis not the main factor responsible for VDA-mediated cell\nmembrane permeabilization. There are highly VDA active MJH\nsuch as BL-204, GL-308-2, and GL-356-2 with relatively low logP\nvalues. In contrast, there aremolecules such as BL-141-1 and BL-\n142 with relatively high logP values that should have high concentrations\nin the lipid bilayers but are not the most VDA active.\nThis is evidence that the VDA activities are not simply due to\nthe amount of MJH bound into the lipid bilayers but include the\nplasmon-mediated action that defines the VDA activity.\nThe lack of full correlation between logP values and VDA activity\ndoes not mean that the binding of MJH into the lipid bilayers\nis not playing a role. In a select group of molecules, ICG, GL-\n328-2, GL-286, and GL-291-2, the logP values correlate well with\nthe VDA activity (Figure S32, Supporting Information). This correlation\nmight exist because the molecules have the same plasmonic\ncore structure and the same alkyl chain length, although\nthey have different alkyl chain functional groups.\nMolecules BL-204 and GL-308-2 have low logP values but\nthe highest VDA activities for permeabilizing cell membranes\n(Figures S33,S34, Supporting Information) and the highest plasmonicity\nindex (Figure S12, Supporting Information), evidence\nthatmolecular plasmon is responsible for the VDA-mediated cell\nmembrane permeabilization. Possibly, the protonated secondary\namine, close to the core plasmonic structure, causes the moiety to\nact as an electron-withdrawing group to enhance its plasmonicity.\n2.10. Some MJH Preferentially Target Mitochondria While Others\nTarget the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)\nThe specific localization of the MJH was studied by fluorescence\nconfocal microscopy using MitoTracker, a marker for localization\nin mitochondria; ER-Tracker, amarker for localization in ER;\nand CellMask, a marker for localization in the outer cell membrane;\nin Figures S35\u2013S38 (Supporting Information). A group of\nMJH preferentially localized in mitochondria: Cy5.5-amine, Cy7-\namine, GL-261-2, BL-242, and BL-141-2. Other MJH preferentially\nlocalized in the ER: GL-308-2 and BL-142. BL-141-1 did not\nshow preferential localization. This can explain the differences\nin VDA activity that we observe in BL-141-2, BL-142, and BL-141-\n1. In these three compounds, there is no correlation between the\nVDA activity, the plasmonicity index, or the logP values. This suggests\nthat the selective binding of these compounds within the\ncell membranes is playing a major role in the VDA activity. This\nis supported by MD simulations that predict different binding\nmodes for BL-141-2, BL-142, and BL-141-1 in which the structural\nvariation is only in their side chains (Figure 4).\nFigure 6.

Melatonin was measured through\ncollected saliva samples, as shown in Figure 1. Because\nmelatonin is considered a \u201cbiological night\u201d hormone,31 the\nprotocol was designed to allow larger numbers of salivary\nsamples to be taken at nighttime. All participants were required\nto provide approximately 2 mL of saliva samples directly into\nan individual sterile tube at the specified time (a total of 15\ntime points). All samples were kept frozen at \u221260 \u00b0C until\nassayed.

The ELISA kit had a detection limit of\n0.78 to 50 pg/mL. During the sampling period, the participants\nwere instructed to avoid caffeinated food and drinks, and the\nmean values of the duplicates were used for analyzing the\nresult.\n2.6. Statistical Analysis. All statistical analyses were\nperformed using the IBM SPSS Statistic 26 program. Because\nthe melatonin level is greatly suppressed during the daytime,\nthe melatonin levels according to the lighting environments\nwere only analyzed from 00:00 to 08:00 on the third day when\n25% of the maximum melatonin level was exceeded. In\nparticular, melatonin levels vary widely among individuals, and\ntherefore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, a nonparametric\nanalysis, was performed (significant threshold was p < 0.05).\nMelatonin data were missing for a total of three subjects (two\nsubjects in c-LED environment and one subject in HC-LED\nenvironment) at the last time point used in the analysis, but all\nremaining data were used. To analyze the SSS score, paired t\ntests were performed at two time points. Analysis results are\nrepresented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM).\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe spectra for circadian rhythm and melatonin were derived\nfrom previous study.27 It described the normalized spectra of\nthe melanopic sensitivity function (Nz(\u03bb)) and the photopic\nspectral luminous efficiency function (V(\u03bb)). The human eye is\nmost sensitive to light centered at a wavelength of 555 nm for\nphotopic vision in terms of brightness, but light is much more\neffective when located at a wavelength of 480 nm for melatonin\nproduction.6,7 However, the most commonly used chip\nwavelength range in the LED industry is 440 to 460 nm, and\na white LED package generally consists of one blue chip\ncorresponding to that wavelength range. Green and red or\nyellow phosphors are excited by blue light emitted from the\nchip. Cyan-color chips with wavelengths above 470 nm are\nrarely used in display and lighting applications because of their\nrelatively low LE and low conversion efficiency to green or red\nphosphors. As such, it is difficult to fill the 460 to 500 nm\nregion, and this gap is shown best at approximately 480 nm\nwith a c-LED. Taking this into consideration, as shown in\nFigure 4, HC-LEDs were designed with two blue chips that\nFigure 4. Microscopic images of (a) no current and (b) low current\n(15 mA) applied to 3.0 \u00d7 3.0 mm2 sized human-centric (HC)-LED\npackage with two blue chips. The peak wavelengths of the light\nemitted from the left and right chips were approximately 480 and 450\nnm, respectively.\nhave been specifically customized for circadian stimulation: a\nconventional blue chip that emits light with a wavelength of\n440 to 460 nm and a chip that emits light with a wavelength of\n470 to 480 nm considering circadian rhythm. In addition, the\nselected LED package platform employs a size of 3.0 \u00d7 3.0\nmm2, presently the most widely used dimensions throughout\nthe LED industry, thus ensuring flexibility in lighting module\ndesign. Optical images of the HC-LED tested at an applied\ncurrent of 15 mA indicate that both chips typically emit blue\nlight and that the color difference was due to different\nwavelengths. To prevent an uneven current phenomenon that\nmay occur with the application of two chips, the package is\ndesigned with a serial circuit, which is clearly identified\nthrough a wire connected across the two blue chips.\nThe M/P ratio is the ratio of equivalent melanopic lux\n(EML) to photopic illuminance and is considered an indicator\nof circadian efficiency.27 In other words, the higher the M/P\nratio is, the higher the melatonin suppression at the same\nilluminance will be. In this regard, the spectra of daytime HCLEDs\nfor melatonin suppression were designed to focus on the\nmelanopic sensitivity located at a wavelength of 480 nm\nthrough an increase in the M/P ratio. The performance\nincluding the optical properties of the daytime HC-LED is\nsummarized in Table 2.

In particular, a significant number of people\nspend up to 90% of their time under indoor electrical\nlighting.20 This means that, during the day, we can be exposed\nto bright artificial lighting with radiation energy of approximately\n480 nm wavelength, which is equivalent to a sufficient\ndose of actual daylight. This specific light, which is associated\nwith melatonin suppression and secretion, can be applied to\nfunctional artificial lighting to regulate alertness, sleep, and the\ncircadian rhythm.21\u221223\nThe attention of many researchers is shifting from the\nperformance of lighting in terms of energy to lighting quality\nthat can affect human productivity, comfort, mood, safety, and\nhealth.24 As such, many researchers and experts have thought\nabout lighting as \u201ccircadian lighting\u201d, \u201cbiological lighting\u201d, and\n\u201chuman-centric lighting (HCL)\u201d. Some studies have offered\nevidence and support of a high CRI, the convenience of smart\nlighting, low glaring lighting, and melatonin related lighting for\nHCL.25 Furthermore, to produce a lighting effect on the\nhuman body, there are various ways to adjust the correlatedcolor\ntemperature (CCT) using warm-white (WW), coolwhite\n(CW), and near-ultraviolet (n-UV) LEDs, similar to the\nsunlight spectrum.26 In this study, we developed LED packages\nfocused on blue light with a wavelength of 480 nm, which is\ndirectly related to melatonin secretion and suppression, as\nHCL. Because the melatonin concentration should be\nmaintained differently during the daytime and nighttime, our\nhuman-centric (HC)-LEDs were developed separately for\ndaytime and nighttime. White HC-LED packages containing\ntwo blue chips emitting light with a wavelength of 450 and 480\nnm were implemented to have a total 12 types of CCT\ndepending on the application. In addition, HC-LED packages\nhave almost the same color coordinates as conventional LED\n(c-LED) packages having the same CCT, and hence, there is\nno change in perceived color. Ultimately, to verify the\nnonvisual effects of the developed LED package, melatonin\nlevel data from 22 voluntary participants were collected under\nc- and HC-LED lighting environments with the same\nilluminance and CCT. The melatonin concentration analysis\nresults indicate that the light-induced melatonin control was\nmore effective in the HC-LED lighting environment with a\nregulated wavelength of 480 nm considering the circadian\nrhythm than in the c-LED lighting environment. Therefore, the\ndaytime and nighttime HC-LEDs can be sufficiently used for\nindoor lighting from a human point of view rather than from\nan energy point of view, and HC-LEDs can help to enhance\nthe circadian rhythm of people today who spend most of their\ntime indoors.\n2. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\n2.1. LED Package and Spectral Design. The LED\npackage design consists of two chips: (1) a chip emitting light\nwith a wavelength of 470 to 480 nm for melatonin suppression\nand secretion control and (2) another chip emitting light with\na wavelength of 445 to 455 nm to secure the original optical\nproperties of a blue light emitter. The spectral designs varied\nfrom WW with a CCT of 1800 K to CW with a CCT of 6500\nK. The designed LED package was divided into two types of\nLEDs according to the usage time period: (1) daytime LEDs\nwith a CCT of 3000 to 6500 K were designed to rapidly\nsuppress melatonin immediately after waking up and improve\nsubjective drowsiness, and (2) nighttime LEDs with a CCT of\n1800 to 4000 K were designed to activate melatonin secretion\nat night. For all types of LEDs, a CRI of >80 was achieved. The\ncharacteristics of the prepared dual-blue-chip LEDs were\nevaluated using an integrating sphere with a diameter of 300\nmm by applying a current of 150 mA. The melanopic/\nphotopic (M/P) ratio, which is considered the ratio of\nmagnitude of nonvisual effects of the developed LED, was\ncompared with that of a c-LED series (LM302Z+, Samsung\nElectronics, Co., Ltd., Korea) with the same package structure,\npower consumption, and CCT (see Table S1). The M/P ratio\nis expressed by the following equation:27\nE N d\nK E V d\nM/Pratio\n72983.25 ( ) ( )\nm ( ) ( )\ne, z\ne,\n=\n(1)\nwhere Ee,\u03bb(\u03bb) is the spectral irradiance, Nz(\u03bb) is the melanopic\nsensitivity curve, V(\u03bb) is the photopic spectral luminous\nefficiency function, and Km is the maximum spectral luminous\nefficacy of 683.002 lm/W.\n2.2.

In PSQI-K, the cutoff score between good and poor\nsleepers was modified from 5 to 8.5 in the process of adapting\nthe conventional PSQI into Korean.28 Therefore, all\nparticipants were considered to have a normal circadian\nrhythm.

The clinical importance of\nthe algorithm can be significant if its use is just as effective as\nfor other neurodegenerative diseases. Third, the algorithm is\nbased on a standard open-source algorithm that is trained on 1\nsample of data by adjusting coefficients; it may not work that\nwellwithnewsources fromother populations.We tried tominimize\nthis by testing our algorithm function on 2 independent\nexternal hospital data sets.

It is recently\nshown that cyanine dyes act as molecular jackhammers (MJH) through\nvibronic (vibrational and electronic mode coupling) driven activation that\ncauses the molecule to stretch longitudinally and axially through concerted\nwhole molecule vibrations. However, the theoretical and experimental\nunderpinnings of these plasmon-driven motions in molecules are difficult to\nassess. Here the use of near-infrared (NIR) light-activated plasmons in a\nbroad array of MJH that mechanically disassemble membranes and\ncytoskeletons in human melanoma A375 cells is described. The\ncharacteristics of plasmon-driven molecular mechanical disassembly of\nsupramolecular biological structures are observed and recorded using\nreal-time fluorescence confocal microscopy. Molecular plasmon resonances in\nMJH are quantified through a new experimental plasmonicity index method.\nThis is done through the measurement of the UV\u2013vis\u2013NIR spectra in various\nsolvents, and quantification of the optical response as a function of the\nsolvent polarity.

Introduction\nPlasmons are the collective oscillation of the conduction band\nelectrons in materials upon their optical excitation.[1] Optical\nplasmons can strongly absorb light, thereby concentrating their\nelectric fields.[2,3] This has been exploited\nfor a wide range of applications including\noptoelectronic devices,[4,5] sensors,[6\u20138]\nultrasensitive analyte detection,[9,10]\ncancer theranostics,[11] solar energy\nharvesting,[12,13] water desalinization,[14]\nand photocatalysis.[15,16] Most of the research\nand applications of optical plasmons\nhave been conducted in metallic\nor semimetallic nanomaterials.[17\u201319]\nIn contrast, while molecular plasmons\nhave been theoretically proposed, they\nhave only recently been investigated\nexperimentally.[20,21] Molecular plasmons\ncouple the vibrational and electronic\nmodes, resulting in concerted vibrational\nmotion that is useful for mechanical work.\nPlasmon-driven motion had been described\nusing energy transfer from a scanning\ntunneling microscopy tip to a zinc phthalocyanine\nadsorbed on a sodium chloride\nfilm, permitting the exciton formation\nand shuttling motion of the molecule.[22]\nThe mechanism was attributed to i) direct\nenergy tunneling into the molecule and\nelectron\u2013hole exciton formation and/or ii)\nnanocavity plasmon formation in between\nthe tip and the substrate, permitting plasmon-driven energy\ntransfer to the molecule for exciton formation, which then induces\nthe shuttling motion. The authors did not attribute the excitation\nto that of a molecular plasmon intrinsic to the molecule.\nBased on experimental data and theoretical calculations, we\nrecently showed that cyanine dyes support intrinsic molecular\nplasmon resonances upon near-infrared (NIR) light excitation,\nenabling mechanical permeabilization of cell membranes.[23]\nThese molecules were termed molecular jackhammers (MJH)\nbecause the light-activated plasmons within the molecule coupled\nto a concerted whole-molecule vibration, leading to a\nvibronic-driven action (VDA). In our previous study,[23] the results\nsupport thatmechanical action is a highly plausible working\nmechanism of the VDA in plasmon-driven MJH. We demonstrated\nhow to distinguish the VDA mechanical effects from\nthermal and photochemical reactions. In short, the evidence is\nas follows: VDA is distinct from both photodynamic therapy and\nphotothermal therapy in that the VDA mechanical effect on the\ncell membrane is not retarded by high doses of inhibitors of\nreactive oxygen species (ROS), and VDA does not itself induce an\nincrease in the temperature of the media; it is also unaffected by", "metadata": {"name": "How to Build Plasmon-Driven Molecular Jackhammers that Disassemble Cell Membranes and Cytoskeletons in Cancer", "page": 1, "pdf_id": "10c5984f-d755-4b18-be0b-84d66e2cdd8a"}, "id": "19"}, {"document": "Fig. 4: Long wavelength illumination was less disruptive to activity rhythms in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.

This will be discussed\nfurther below.\nStructural elements in MJH and mechanism of action\nA summary of the proposed working mechanism is described in Fig. 1f\nand expanded in Extended Data Fig. 2. The binding of the aminocyanine\nto the cells is possibly mediated through the interaction of the charge\non its pendant amine moiety with the negatively charged phospholipids\n(Extended Data Fig. 3), and light-activated VDA opens the cell membranes.\nThe structures of the MJHs and their classification according\nto their expected relative strength in the VDA (plasmonicity), based\non the extension of the indole with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\nand the length of the \u03c0-conjugation in the polymethine bridge, are\npresented in Extended Data Fig. 2. In another experiment, the aminocyanine\nCy5-amine was added as a competitor for cell binding against\nCy7.5-amine; the results showed a reduction of the permeabilization\nactivity of Cy7.5-amine (Supplementary Fig. 3). The optical spectra of\nall of the aminocyanines used in this study and the characterization of\ntheir binding to A375 human melanoma cells by confocal microscopy\nare presented in Extended Data Fig. 4.\nConsistent with the VDA proposed here, excitation of the 680 nm\nvibronic shoulder in Cy7-amine improves the MJH effect for opening\ncell membranes in A375 cells (Extended Data Fig. 5). However, the permeabilization\nis not as great as for 730 nm excitation of Cy7.5-amine,\neven when exciting the 680 nm shoulder of Cy7-amine using an\nequal light dose of 80 mW cm\u22122 for 10 min. This might result because\nCy7-amine lacks the extended aryl rings of Cy7.5-amine, limiting the\nTMP of the vibronic mode. Hence, Cy7-amine is a weaker MJH than\nCy7.5-amine because of the lower plasmonicity of indole compared\nwith benzoindole (Fig. 1d).\nStructure\u2013activity relationship in MJH-mediated cell\nmembrane opening\nWe compared Cy7-amine and Cy7.5-amine by exciting various concentrations\nof these cyanines at 730 nm (Fig. 3), and observed that\nCy7.5-amine is much more efficient at permeabilizing cells upon VDA\ninduced by NIR light.

Social deficits were observed in mutants of both sexes. Hence, both sexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive behavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work has found that LPS-induced maternal immune activation caused male-specific deficits in behavior and gene expression in the Cntnap2 KO line (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked whether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by DLaN treatment. In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interactions), we found that both sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN (Table 5; S. Fig. 2). The females Cntnap2 KO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still overall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 mutation and the negative influence of DLaN.\nPrior work has shown that activation of ipRGC can drive c-Fos expression in several brain regions including those in the hypothalamus and limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; Fernandez et al., 2018). We sought to determine whether the 2-weeks of DLaN would alter c-Fos expression in some of those brain regions (Fig. 7). In contrast to the effects of the light when the mice were held in DD (Fig. 1), we did not see any evidence that the chronic nightly high melanopic illumination increased c-Fos in the SCN. Similarly, we did not see increased c-Fos expression in the PVH and LH. Interestingly, the chemogenetic activation of ipRGCs, did induced c-Fos expression in these two regions (Milosavljevic et al., 2016). The difference may well be the relatively weak light stimulus used in the present study or the difference between acute chemogenetic activation vs. chronic stimulation with the DLaN. We did find that our high melanopic DLaN did increases c-Fos expression in the pHb and BLA. Prior work has implicated the pHb as a region critically involved in the effects of light on mood (Fernandez et al., 2018). Specifically, there is support for circuit by which the ipRGC regulation of the dorsal region of the pHb projects to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to drive depressive-like behaviors (An et al., 2020). Thus, we would expect to see DLaN driven alterations in depressive behaviors in our mouse models (Fonken et al., 2012; Bedrosian et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2020) and this will be an important area for future work. More critical for the present study, prior work suggests that the BLA may regulate repetitive behavior (Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014; Sun et al., 2019). Using a reporter for a glutamate transporter (vGlut2), we were able to show that the c-Fos induction occurs robustly, although certainly not exclusively, in a glutamatergic cell population in the BLA (Fig. 7).", "metadata": {"name": "Long wavelength light reduces the negative consequences of dim light at night in the Cntnap2 mouse model of autism.", "page": 16, "pdf_id": "8c4f75e5-13ff-4557-86d8-987327daba1a"}, "id": "82"}, {"document": "Figure 3.

Our findings indicate that exposure to short \u03bb enriched DLaN disrupted social behavior in both genotypes, and the use of longer \u03bb illumination could effectively reduce the impact of DLaN on social behavior.\nReduced melanopic illumination prevents DLaN-driven disruption of repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO mice.\nWe have previously shown that DLaN increases repetitive behavior in Cntnap2 KO mutants but not in WT (Wang et al., 2020), hence, we explored the effects of the two lighting treatments on grooming behavior. As previously observed, the Cntnap2 KO exhibited higher levels of grooming than WT mice under baseline conditions, and neither DLaN treatment altered the levels of grooming in WT mice (Fig. 6, Table 3). The short \u03bb enriched DLaN treatment triggered a selective increase in the time of grooming in the Cntnap2 KO mice (Fig. 6, Table 3). In particular, the short \u03bb DLaN increased grooming (>10%) in 16 out of the 22 KO mice evaluated while the long \u03bb DLaN only affected 4 mutants (Fig. 6B, C). Our observations demonstrate that the impact of DLaN on repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO was dependent upon the \u03bb used and that the mutants are selectively vulnerable to the effects of DLaN on repetitive behavior.\nLimited Sex differences in the DLaN-driven behavioral changes in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.\nGiven the strong male bias in prevalence of ASD, we powered our behavioral studies to detect possible sex difference in behavior. First, we compared key measures of activity rhythms, social interactions and grooming between the two genotypes in mice held in the LD cycle. Most activity parameters varied with genotype but not sex (Table 4) with the Cntnap2 KO showing hypo-activity throughout the night. As has been described previously, the activity waveforms were more robust in the WT females compared with males with higher activity levels in the early night (Supplemental Fig. 1). We found a similar situation for social behavior where there were significant effects of genotype but not sex (Table 4). By contrast, for grooming behavior there were significant effects of both genotype and sex with the female mutants showing significantly altered measures of repetitive behavior (Table 4). Next, we compared these same parameters in male and female WT and Cntnap2 KO mice held under short \u03bb enriched DLaN conditions. Under these conditions, there were no significant sex differences in any of the behaviors. For activity measures, there were not even differences between the genotypes as all of rhythms were compromised (Table 5; Supplemental Fig. 2). For social interactions and grooming, both sexes were compromised more in the mutant mice (Table 5). In short, although we powered our sample size to detect possible sex differences, for the most part, both sexes were impacted by the Cntnap2 mutation.

Overall, the masking and\ndim light experiments demonstrated that 3xTg mice respond more\nintensely than WT mice to dim light, both as a masking stimulus\nand an entrainment cue. This supports the hypothesis that altered\nretinal function contributes to differing circadian behavior.\nWe next analyzed the retinas of aged 3xTg mice by\nimmunohistochemistry. Though we detected Ab and tau\nphosphorylation in the retinas of 13 mo 3xTg mice (Figures 5A, B),\nwe did not observe gross changes to retinal morphology or the RGC\npopulation (Figure 5C), and there was no significant decrease in\nRGC density in 3xTg retinas (p > 0.298) (Figure 5D). Interestingly,\nwe found a 64% increase in the density of melanopsin-positive\nipRGCs in the retinas of these 3xTg mice compared with WT\n(p < 0.019) (Figures 5E, F). All retinal tissue samples were\ncollected between zeitgeber time (ZT) 5\u20138 and ipRGC density\nwas averaged across images from multiple regions of the retina\nto minimize the effects of rhythmicity (Hannibal et al., 2005) and\nregional disparities (Dacey et al., 2005) in melanopsin expression.\nThis increase in the ipRGC population may contribute to the\nheightened sensitivity to light as a circadian cue in 3xTg mice.\nDiscussion\nWe found that two amyloid-based AD mouse models have\nsignificantly accelerated re-entrainment in a jet lag paradigm. This\nbehavioral phenotype was not affected by the depletion of microglia\nand did not depend on the presence of tauopathy.

As measured by grooming, the repetitive behavior is not as robust a phenotype in the female mutants.\nReduced melanopic illumination diminished DLaN induction of c-Fos in the basolateral amygdala in Cntnap2 KO mice.\nPrior work has shown that activation of the ipRGC can drive cFos expression in several brain regions including the hypothalamus and the limbic system (Milosavljevic et al., 2016; Fernandez et al., 2018). Hence, to unravel some of the possible mechanisms underlying the impacts of DLaN on autistic behaviors, we examined c-Fos immunoreactivity across different brain regions known to be implicated in the control of repetitive behavior, such as the BLA, Periventricular Nucleus (PVN), and Lateral Hypothalamus (LH). For controls, we also examined possible DLaN driven c-Fos expression to two areas known to receive light information from ipRGC including the SCN and peri-Habenular nucleus (pHb). Compared to mice held on a standard LD cycle, WT and Cntnap2 KO mice exposed for 2 weeks to the short \u03bb enriched DLaN displayed a significantly increased number in c-Fos positive cells in both the BLA and pHb, but not in other brain regions of interest (Fig. 7, Table 6). In contrast, the long \u03bb enriched DLaN did not induced c-Fos expression in any of these regions. Prior work suggested that the glutamatergic cell population in the BLA is a critical part of a circuit responsible for repetitive behavior (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016). Therefore, we crossed the Cntnap2 KO line into mice that expressed both vGAT2-Cre (Vong et al., 2011) and a Cre-dependent reporter ZsGreen1 (Ai6) (Madisen et al., 2010), which provides strong cell body labelling. WT and Cntnap2 KO mice with these reporters were then exposed to short \u03bb enriched DLaN for two weeks. The expression of the vGlut2-ZsGreen1 reporter within the BLA region was robust in both the WT and mutants. Most importantly, the short \u03bb DLaN elicited a higher number of vGlut2-ZsGreen1/cFos immunopositive in the Cntnap2 KO mice (Table 7) in comparison to the WT under DLaN or the WT and mutants under LD conditions. Both genotypes exhibited a significantly higher co-expression in the light treated group (Table 7).

In summary, through the absorbance\nof a suitable energy of light, a molecule\u2019s collective electronic\nexcitations hybridize with the molecule\u2019s vibrational modes to induce\nthe vibronic mode11. The vibronic mode is analogous to an ultrafast\nbreathing mode of a molecule, where the entire molecule vibrates in\nunison throughout its length and its width because both longitudinal\nor transverse collective vibration, respectively, may occur10\u201312. The\nexistence of these longitudinal and transverse collective vibrations in\nmolecules, also referred to as molecular plasmons as they are coupled\nprocesses, were first described theoretically by Cui et al. in 2016 and\nmore recently observed experimentally by Kong et al. in 202110,11.\nHere we show that when a suitable vibronic-mode-supported\nmolecule is bound to a cell membrane, it can rapidly compromise\nthe integrity of the membrane in a manner and rate that no partial\nmolecular vibration (Fig. 1a) or disconcerted vibrations (Fig. 1b) can\ninduce. Heating a molecule through photothermal therapy can cause\nmany vibrations in a molecule, but those vibrations are not coordinated\n(Fig. 1b), hence there is no concerted longitudinal or transverse vibration\nthat is sufficient to rapidly open a cell membrane. High powers\nand extended times are therefore required in photothermal therapy\nto cause slower apoptotic death. Conversely, VDA of a cell-associated\nmolecule results in rapid necrosis even at very low energies. While photodynamic\ntherapy generates ROS, VDA from a cell-associated molecule\ncauses cell death that is unaffected by large doses of ROS inhibitors.\nCyanine dyes have been used in photothermal and photodynamic\ntherapies and they are readily accepted in biological and medicinal\nstudies19\u201323. We have exploited the VDA of these classical structures to\nkill cells 10\u201350 times faster than can be achieved with photothermal\nor photodynamic therapies, with concentrations 10 times lower than\nare generally used and with 10\u201350 times lower power than is often used\n(80 mW cm\u22122 instead of 1\u20134 W cm\u22122).\nResults and discussion\nVibrational excitation of aminocyanines\nCyanine structures are characterized by an odd-numbered polyene\nlinker connecting two nitrogen-containing heterocycles with unusual\nphotophysical properties24\u201328. The absorption spectra of cyanines are\ndominated by an absorption band in the visible\u2013NIR electromagnetic\nspectrum with a shoulder located at higher energy (shorter wavelength).\nCy7.5-amine has an additional aryl ring in each of the heterocyclic\nmoieties compared with Cy7-amine (Fig. 1d), which increases\nthe conjugation, causing a redshift of its absorption by ~40 nm relative\nto Cy7-amine.\nWe postulated that the higher-energy shoulder next to the large\nabsorption band in symmetrical cyanine structures results from the\ncoupling of a molecular plasmon (a dominant collective oscillation of\nelectronic excitation) to a dominant collective vibrational excitation,\nin agreement with the suggestion in the literature that the absorption\nsub-bands in the spectra of cyanines are primarily determined\nby a dominant symmetric vibration rather than a collection of single\nvibrations9. This vibronic behaviour, through the coupling of electronic\nand vibrational states, is a feature of conjugated-backbone\nnear-symmetrical cyanines, such as Cy7-amine and Cy7.5-amine. The\nshoulder (\u03bb \u2248 730 nm) in the absorption spectrum of Cy7.5-amine corresponds\nto this collective vibrational mode (Fig. 1e). The same collective\nvibrational mode is present in Cy7-amine, but at ~690 nm. The molecular\nplasmons in cyanines were indeed confirmed by time-dependent\ndensity functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations; these molecules\ncan support longitudinal molecular plasmons (LMPs) and transversal\nmolecular plasmons (TMPs; Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1). The\nshoulder band (730 nm by experiment, 750 nm by TD-DFT calculation)\nis not the only vibronic mode present in the absorption spectrum of\nCy7.5-amine, but rather the strongest in vibronic character spreading\nthroughout the length and width of the molecule (Supplementary\nVideo 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). This can be observed by contrasting\nthe vibrational mode of the 750 nm shoulder in Supplementary Video 1\nwith the other concerted vibrational modes at 809, 530 and 430 nm in\nSupplementary Videos 2\u20134, respectively, obtained from first-principles\nTD-DFT vibrational calculations. The larger band at ~780 nm (809 nm\ncalculated by TD-DFT), predominantly a longitudinal charge density\nresonance, the small peak at ~400 nm (430 nm calculated by TD-DFT),\nprimarily a transversal charge density resonance, and the shoulder at\n~450 nm (530 nm calculated by TD-DFT), with a predominant short longitudinal\ncharge density resonance, also have vibronic properties with\ncharge density resonances typical of a molecular plasmon10 (Extended\nData Fig. 1). It is important to recognize that the TD-DFT calculations\ndescribe more accurately the longer wavelengths (780 and 730 nm) of\nthe absorption bands in the spectrum. The longitudinal contributions\nto the resonances at the shorter wavelengths (~400\u2013600 nm) are inaccurately\noverestimated by TD-DFT (Extended Data Fig. 1a\u2013c).\nPreviously, Yang et al. resolved a vibrational frequency at 1,310 cm\u22121\n(this is equivalent to 25 fs per oscillation or a frequency of 4 \u00d7 1013 s\u22121)\nfor 1,1\u2032,3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-hexamethyl-4,4\u2032,5,5\u2032-dibenzo-2,2\u2032-indotricarbocyanine\nusing wavelength-resolved femtosecond pump\u2013probe spectroscopy\nwhen the vibronic shoulder was selectively excited; however, the\nidentity of the absorption shoulder was not explained in that study18.\nGiven that our TD-DFT analysis strongly supports that the absorption\nshoulder represents the concerted whole-molecule vibronic mode,\nwe can expect that this reported band at 1,310 cm\u22121 corresponds to\nthe vibrational frequency of the concerted whole-molecule vibration.\nCorroborating this assumption, this frequency has been reported to\ncorrespond to one dominant vibration with a nearly constant value\n(~1,310\u20131,375 cm\u22121) in indocyanine structures. This value matches the\nenergy spacing between the two dominant absorption sub-bands,\nwhich represent the vibronic shoulder next to the absorption peak9,28.\nMoreover, resonance Raman spectroscopy has determined that this is\nan intensity-dominant vibrational band at 1,365 cm\u22121 in the spectrum\nof Cy5 and confirmed for other cyanines29,30. Specifically, for Cy7.5 this\nvibrational frequency has been measured at ~1,370 cm\u22121 (this is 24 fs\nper oscillation or a frequency of 4.1 \u00d7 1013 s\u22121) using Raman spectroscopy30.\nThese subpicosecond concerted whole-molecule vibrations\nare terahertz-timescale (41 THz) oscillations, that is, they are seven\norders of magnitude faster than the megahertz (2\u20133 MHz) rotations\nelicited by Feringa-type motors1.\nMJH-mediated VDA on cells\nWe selectively excited the vibronic mode in a cell-membrane-bound\nCy7.5-amine using a NIR light-emitting diode (LED) at 730 nm\n(Fig. 1e), which resulted in the permeabilization of the cellular membrane\nto 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Fig. 1f). DAPI is a\ncell-membrane-impermeable dye in viable cells that mainly stains cellular\nDNA in membrane-disrupted cells. While 730 nm light does not\nexcite the vibronic shoulder of Cy7-amine, it can activate Cy7.5-amine\n(Fig. 1e) and permeabilize A375 human melanoma cells immediately\nafter treatment (Fig. 2a\u2013f). It took ~30 s from the time the sample\nwas irradiated to start collecting the data in the flow cytometer. For\nthis experiment, 1 \u03bcM Cy7.5-amine and 730 nm LED irradiation at\n80 mW cm\u22122 for 10 min caused permeabilization to DAPI staining of\n99.6% of the A375 cells in a cell suspension containing 2 \u00d7 105 cells. In\ncontrast, Cy7-amine was not able to permeabilize the cells under the\nsame conditions. This difference between the two aminocyanines\nsupports the notion that the 730 nm light can excite the vibronic\nmode (shoulder) in Cy7.5-amine (Fig. 1e) causing cellular membrane\npermeabilization and ultimately cell death by necrosis, as seen by\nimmediate DAPI staining. The flow cytometry measurements showed\nthat both aminocyanines were attached efficiently to the cells in the\nabsence of irradiation (Fig. 2b,c). It is interesting that Cy7-amine has a\nhigher extinction coefficient (\u03b5 = 132,000 M\u22121 cm\u22121) at \u03bb = 730 nm than\nCy7.5-amine (\u03b5 = 72,000 M\u22121 cm\u22121) in water, yet Cy7-amine does not permeabilize\nthe cells at comparable concentrations, while Cy7.5-amine permeabilizes the cells readily upon excitation (Fig. 2). This result suggests\nthat a photothermal effect is not operating as Cy7-amine has a\nhigher absorption cross-section than Cy7.5-amine at 730 nm. Likewise,\nphotodynamic therapy is unlikely as the Cy7 and Cy7.5 cyanines have\nsimilar yields for singlet oxygen generation31.

Tour 1,5\nThrough the actuation of vibronic modes in cell-membrane-associated\naminocyanines, using near-infrared light, a distinct type of molecular\nmechanical action can be exploited to rapidly kill cells by necrosis.\nVibronic-driven action (VDA) is distinct from both photodynamic therapy\nand photothermal therapy as its mechanical effect on the cell membrane\nis not abrogated by inhibitors of reactive oxygen species and it does not\ninduce thermal killing. Subpicosecond concerted whole-molecule vibrations\nof VDA-induced mechanical disruption can be achieved using very low\nconcentrations (500 nM) of aminocyanines or low doses of light (12 J cm\u22122,\n80 mW cm\u22122 for 2.5 min), resulting in complete eradication of human\nmelanoma cells in vitro. Also, 50% tumour-free efficacy in mouse models\nfor melanoma was achieved. The molecules that destroy cell membranes\nthrough VDA have been termed molecular jackhammers because they\nundergo concerted whole-molecule vibrations. Given that a cell is unlikely\nto develop resistance to such molecular mechanical forces, molecular\njackhammers present an alternative modality for inducing cancer cell death.\nWe previously used Feringa-type unidirectional rotating molecular\nmotors that bear a rotor and stator and can be activated by ultraviolet\n(UV) or visible light to open pores in cell membranes, resulting\nin rapid necrotic death1. Through the 2\u20133 MHz unidirectional\nrotations in these molecular motors, the drilling action on cellular\nmembranes develops holes in the cell, followed by blebbing\nand death within seconds to minutes of activation. This necrotic\naction is unaffected by inhibitors of radical oxygen species (ROS)2.\nSlower versions of Feringa motors, with rotation rates in the order\nof 1\u2013100 Hz, do not elicit such cell-killing action, further ruling out a\nthermal effect in the killing2. More recently, we studied visible lightactivated\nDube hemithioindigo switches and motors that operate\nin the kilohertz regime3. Despite being too slow to mechanically kill\ncells, these switches promote slower apoptotic cellular death by\ninducing ROS4.\nWhile UV and visible light penetrate only hundreds of micrometres\nto 1 mm through human tissue (skin, muscle and fat), the near-infrared\n(NIR) window of 650\u2013900 nm, also known as the optical therapeutic\nwindow, is ideally suited for in vivo applications owing to minimal\nlight absorption by haemoglobin and water coupled with substantial\npenetration through human tissue reaching ~10 cm (ref. 5). We\nhave previously exploited two-photon NIR activation of Feringa-type\nmotors to induce rapid cellular necrosis, but that technique requires\nlarge laser-generated fluxes of photons and hence the depth of penetration\nis shallow, ~0.5 mm, and the area of coverage is restricted to\nsmaller-sized domains, impractical for broad clinical translation6. In\nthat approach, two photons of 710 nm are required to simultaneously\nhit the molecule and combine via a virtual state into 355 nm energy, a\nlow-probability and thus poorly efficient process, which then activates\nthe rotation of the Feringa-type motor7.

The side chains in the\ncyanine-based MJH influence their permeability into specific cellular\nmembranes. It was observed that Cy5.5-amine binds to the\nouter cell membrane, the nuclear membrane, and the mitochondria\n(Figure S23, Supporting Information). The same binding\npattern was observed for Cy7.5-amine, Cy7-amine, Cy5-amine\nin our former study, exemplifying that cyanines with the same\nside chain bind in similar ways into the cellular membranes.[23]\nThis further justifies that the correlation between VDA-mediated\nactivity and EPI should be studied within groups of molecules\nwith the same side chain to keep the binding mode as a constant\nvariable as shown in Figure 3C and Figures S17\u2013S20 (Supporting\nInformation). The mitochondria targeting is presumably\nthrough a docking interaction with cardiolipin, a phospholipid\nthat is present exclusively in the internal lipid bilayer of\nmitochondria. This is supported by the flow cytometry analyses\nin Figure S24 (Supporting Information),[37\u201339] which shows that\nfree cardiolipin added in the medium interacts with Cy5.5-amine\nand competes with the binding of Cy5.5-amine to the cancer\ncells.\n2.7.

The Effect of Contact Time on the Cytotoxicity of MJH\nUsing a Crystal Violet Test\nThe contact time during the incubation of MJH with A375 cells\nhas a strong effect on the cytotoxicity. Generally, MJH at a short\ncontact time (\u224840 min) showed little to no cytotoxicity (Figure\nS39, Supporting Information). However, at long contact time (1\nor 2 days) MJH became toxic, likely through a slow cytotoxic\nmechanism. Interestingly, in some cases, we have observed that\nMJH such as GL-261-2 can increase the cell viability at short contact\ntime as shown in Figure S39C (Supporting Information) and\nGL-286 at low concentrations (<1 \u03bcm) as shown in Figure S39D\n(Supporting Information). For the short contact times of 40 or\n50 min, the MJH was incubated with A375 cells, then the excess\nwas removed by centrifugation, and the cells were cultured for 2\nd. The cell viability was thenmeasured by a crystal violet test. For\nthe long contact time, the MJH were incubated with A375 cells\nfor 1 or 2 days and then the viability was immediately measured\nby a crystal violet test (Figures S40,S41, Supporting Information).\nThe mild effects at short contact time (\u224840\u201350 min) are through\na slow cell killing mechanism, likely apoptosis since the more\ncomplete killing is observed after culturing the cells for 2 days.\nThis contrasts with the necrotic cell death induced by NIR-lightactivated\nVDA that takes 10 min to kill the cells. These are two\ndistinctive, and in some aspects opposing,mechanisms of action\nfor cell death.[42,43]\nThe question that arises regarding the MJH cytotoxicity without\nlight activation is: Does the MJH toxicity directly correlate to\nthe VDA activity? To answer this question, we built 2D correlation\nplots comparing the VDA activity under light activation versus\nthe toxicity of the molecules without light activation (Figure\nS42, Supporting Information). There is no direct correlation between\nthe VDA activity and inherent toxicity. More importantly,\nBL-142, with relatively low inherent toxicity with respect to others,\nretains high VDA activity. The VDA activity was measured by\nflow cytometry at 10 min immediately after light treatment while\nthe inherent toxicity wasmeasured by crystal violet test after continuous\nMJH exposure to the cells for 2 days.\n2.12. The Effect of Contact Time in the Cytotoxicity of MJH Using\nClonogenic Assay\nFor additional assessment of the VDA activity versus the inherent\ntoxicity, both properties were measured using a clonogenic\nassay for cell viability. The exposure time in both experiments\nwas equal (Figure S43, Supporting Information), 7 h for both,\nfollowed by culture of the cells for 7 days to allow colony formation.\nThe cell survival was calculated at the end of the colony\nformation (Figures S44,S47, Supporting Information). Lower inherent\ntoxicity molecules from Figure S42 (Supporting Information)\nwere included in the analysis; additional molecules were\nsynthesized seeking to reduce their inherent toxicity. For example,\nfrom Figure S42 (Supporting Information) we identified that\nthe carboxylated GL-261-2 was less toxic than the aminocyanines.\nFollowing this observation, we synthesized BL-242 (Figure S43E,\nSupporting Information). The acetylation of the amine such as in\nGL-362-2 enhanced the toxicity (Figure S43E, Supporting Information).\nOverall, no direct correlation between the light-activated\nVDA activity, and the inherent toxicity was observed (Figure S43A\nvs Figure S43B, Supporting Information). The ratio of inherent\ntoxicity/VDA activity was defined to identify the lead molecule\nwith the highest therapeutic index of VDA activity versus inherent\ntoxicity (Figure S43C, Supporting Information). Specifically,\nthe therapeutic index was defined as the ratio of Tox LC50/VDA\nLC50. BL-141-2 has a convenient high therapeutic index of 22 and\na very low VDA LC50 = 18 nm to eradicate 50% of the cells and\nVDA LC100 = 40 nm to eradicate 100% of the cells. GL-261-2 is\nthe lead molecule with the highest therapeutic index of 62 and\na VDA LC50 = 80 nm (Figure S43D, Supporting Information).\nGL-261-2, with a therapeutic index of \u224860, is a plasmon-driven\nMJH candidate for translation to rodent studies, which is safer\nthan Cy7.5-amine (therapeutic index of \u22482\u20135 depending on the\nmethod used) that was successfully applied in vivo to eradicate\nmelanoma tumors without signs of toxic side effects in mice.[23]\n3. Conclusion\nA library of 23 NIR 730 nm light-activated MJH displaying\nplasmon-driven vibrational action was designed and synthesized\n(Figures 1,2). This library was originally screened for the\nmembrane permeabilization of human melanoma A375 cells\nby VDA upon NIR-light activation, allowing the identification\nof structural elements that improve the plasmon-driven activity\n(Figure 3). A cyanine, BL-204, was the best MJH to permeabilize\ncellular membranes. The contribution of each structural element\nto the plasmonicity of the molecule was quantified by its\nEPI (Figures S12,S13, and S17\u2013S20, Supporting Information).\nThe plasmonicity was improved by synthesizing molecules such\nas GL-308-2 and BL-204 (Figure S12, Supporting Information).\nThe EPI is a method described here to quantify the effects of\nmolecular structure on the activity of the MJH. The theoretical\nplasmonicity index, based on complex quantum mechanical calculations,\nhas been described elsewhere.[44,45] The EPI correlates\nwith the VDA activity when comparing MJH with the same side\nchains but variable cores (Figure 3C; Figures S17\u2013S20, Supporting\nInformation).\nMJH Cy5.5-amine binds to the cellular membrane, nuclear\nmembrane, and mitochondria (Figure S23, Supporting Information).\nIn the mitochondria, the protonated Cy5.5-amine most\nlikely docked in the lipid bilayer to the negatively charged cardiolipin,\na phospholipid exclusively localized in the internal\nmitochondrial membrane, as supported by the flow cytometry\ncompetitive assay (Figure S24, Supporting Information). Similarmolecules\nsuch as Cy7.5-amine, Cy7-amine, Cy5.5-amine, and\nCy5-amine should also dock into the lipid bilayers. It was confirmed\nthat Cy7-amine targets localization in cellularmembranes\nlike Cy5.5-amine (Figure S35, Supporting Information). This is\nsupporting evidence that MJH with similar side chains target\nsimilar sub-cellular organelles.\nPlasmon-driven MJH was utilized to destroy cellular structures;\nthis characteristic can be applied to cancer treatment and\nthe destruction of bacteria, fungi, and viruses.[46,47] The plasmondriven\nMJH might be active in other biomedical applications\nby tuning the NIR-light power intensity and exposure time to\nthe optimal levels for modulation of biological activity, such as\ncell signaling or selective opening of protein channels.[48] Since\nthese MJH are activated in the NIR, they reside in the therapeutic\nwindow that permits efficient light penetration through biological\ntissue, serving as a harbinger for future medical applications\nof molecular machines.", "metadata": {"name": "How to Build Plasmon-Driven Molecular Jackhammers that Disassemble Cell Membranes and Cytoskeletons in Cancer", "page": 11, "pdf_id": "10c5984f-d755-4b18-be0b-84d66e2cdd8a"}, "id": "28"}, {"document": "in the development and function of the nervous system\n(Nguyen et al. 2018; Olde Loohuis et al. 2012). miRNAs have\nemerged as key elements in circadian clock regulation in\nrecent times. Two miRNAs (miR-219 and miR-132) specific\nto the brain influence circadian timing processes (Cheng\net al. 2007). Notably, these two miRNAs are significantly\ndown-regulated in children with ASD (Sarachana et al.\n2010). Besides this, recent studies also identified mRNA\ntargets of ASD-associated miRNAs showing enrichment for\ncircadian-related pathways (Hicks et al. 2020; Huang et al.\n2015).\nGut microbiota plays an important role in epigenetic\nprocesses by producing low molecular weight substances,\nsuch as folate, butyrate, biotin, and acetate. Altered gut\nmicrobiota and low levels of butyrate were reported in\nchildren with ASD (Liu et al. 2019). In an animal model\nstudy, sodium butyrate was shown to attenuate social\nbehavior deficits and modify the transcriptional activity of\ninhibitory/excitatory genes (Kratsman et al. 2016). These\nfindings point towards important role of epigenetic processes\nof circadian elements in ASD pathophysiology.\nImpact of circadian disruption on\npredominant etiological models of\nASD: Quo vadis?\nThere is an increasing interest in the role of the circadian\nrhythm in the regulation of the immune system. As alterations\nin immune function/activity are an integral aspect of\nthe etiology and pathophysiology of ASD, it would be\ninteresting to discern how pineal melatonin may be acting\nvia BMAL1, to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase\n(PDK), thereby disinhibiting the pyruvate dehydrogenase\ncomplex (PDC), leading to an increased conversion of\npyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Anderson et al. 2019). Acetyl-CoA\nincreases ATP from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and\noxidative phosphorylation as well as serves as a necessary\nco-substrate for the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic melatonergic\npathway (Gevezova et al. 2020). It is by such\nprocesses that the circadian rhythm \u2018resets\u2019 immune cells\nand leads to their optimal daytime functioning. Pineal\nmelatonin may also have similar effects on other cell types.\nAs alterations in mitochondrial and immune cell functions\nare important aspects of ASD pathophysiology, it is\nimportant to note the interface of the circadian rhythm with\nmetabolism. Data obtained from studies conducted on\nplatelets, intestinal epithelial cells and the pineal gland\nindicate that melatonin may be suppressed in many body\ncells, at least in part via an increase in microRNAs that\nsuppress the melatonergic pathway (Maes et al. 2019;\nPagan et al. 2017). Besides suppression of pineal melatonin\nproduction, local melatonin production in different cells,\nincluding within the immune cells is also modulated by\ncircadian rhythms. This is an important area for further\ninvestigation as it links circadian dysregulation with\nmetabolism, and thereby alters the regulation of the immune\nresponse. This has etiological (Seo and Anderson\n2019), as well as pathophysiological implications (Anderson\nand Betancort Medina 2019). Such processes also\noverlap with alterations in the gut microbiome, which, as\nnoted, are common in ASD. It would be interesting to note\nthat the decrease in the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, in\nASD may be intimately linked to alterations in circadian\ngene, mitochondrial, immune and melatonergic pathway\nfunctions (Jin et al. 2016; Maes et al. 2019). Microbiome\nderived butyrate increases the melatonergic pathway (Jin\net al. 2016), as well as optimizes mitochondrial function,\npartly by acting via BMAL1 and PDC disinhibition, thereby\noptimizing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and\nimmune cell function (Maes et al. 2019). Changes in the gut\nmicrobiome are therefore important to the regulation of the\nimmune response as well as wider effects via the regulation\nof metabolism (Anderson and Maes 2020).\nCircadian pathway: a potential\ntarget of therapy\nMany studies both in animals as well as in humans have\nconvincingly demonstrated that the pharmacological\nmodulators of the circadian clock could emerge as potential\ntherapeutic drugs in diseases where circadian disruption\nplays a critical pathogenetic role (Antoch and Kondratov\n2013). Recent reports suggest that circadian genes could\nserve as potential therapeutic targets in various pathologies,\nincluding cancers (Elshazley et al. 2012). Circadian\nelements could also be considered as important targets of\ntherapy in ASD. Primary evidence towards this has been\ngarnered from studies on melatonin mediated sleep regulation\nin children with ASD. Given its roles in neurodevelopment,\ncircadian entrainment and sleep regulation\nas well as in ASD risk, melatonin supplementation is a\nputative treatment option for sleep disorders in children\nwith ASD (Lalanne et al. 2021). Melatonin supplementation\nhas shown promising results in treating sleep onset\ninsomnia in children with ASD (Malow et al. 2012, 2021).\nConclusion\nDisrupted circadian rhythm might induce neurodevelopmental\nchanges and drive the pathogenetic\npathways of ASD. Dysregulation of several circadian\ncomponents has also been reported to influence many\nprocesses such as brain development, synaptic plasticity,\nand cognitive skills, which are altered in ASD. But how\ncircadian rhythms impact the developmental pathology in\nASD remains enigmatic. From the fragmented observations\nand individual studies, it is evident that alterations\nin circadian rhythmcan impact neurodevelopment as well\nas immune-inflammatory, metabolic, nitro-oxidative\nstress, and neurotransmitter pathways. This could be\neither through epistatic interactions or epigenetic modifications.\nFuture research in ASD should focus on understanding\nthe impact of disruption in circadian rhythm on\nneurodevelopment by integrating all these immuneinflammatory,\nmetabolic, nitro oxidative stress, and\nneurotransmitter pathways to more precisely understand\nthe interactions between circadian rhythm and the pathophysiological\npathways of ASD and to delineate new\ndrug targets to treat patients with ASD.\nAcknowledgements: MB is supported by an NHMRC Senior\nPrincipal Research Fellowship (1156072).\nAuthor contributions: All the authors have accepted\nresponsibility for the entire content of this submitted\nmanuscript and approved submission.\nResearch funding: Works in the authors\u2019 (MD and JVSK)\nlaboratory are funded by a \u201cCentre for Excellence\u201d grant\nfrom Vision Group of Science and Technology (VGST),\nGovernment of Karnataka (No. KSTePS/VGST-CESEM/\n2018-2019/GRD No. 744/315) for the identification of\nimmune based biomarkers in neurodevelopmental\ndisorders including ASD.

Again, the WT mice exhibited a drastic suppression of activity (42 \u00b1 7%), while the Opn4DTA did not show any significant light-evoked change on their activity (9 \u00b1 9%; Fig. 2C, Table 2). We had previously shown that DLaN reduces social behavior in C57 mice (Wang et al., 2020), hence, the effect of the short \u03bb illumination was examined on this behavior in the Opn4DTA. In WT mice, the DLaN greatly reduced social interactions (57.4 \u00b1 10%), while the mutant mice were resistant to this negative effect of night-time illumination (8.9 \u00b1 8.2%, Fig. 2D, Table 2). Together these data indicate that the ipRGCs are required for at least some of the negative effects of DLaN.\nReduced melanopic illumination prevents DLaN-driven disruption of daily rhythms in activity in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.\nNext, we used the LED array to determine whether long \u03bb enriched illumination would reduce the DLaN disruption of locomotor activity rhythms. Cohorts of Cntnap2 KO and WT mice were first housed under control conditions (LD 12:12), then randomly exposed to either long or short \u03bb enriched DLaN (10 lx) for 2 weeks and the waveforms examined (Fig. 3A). Under baseline conditions, both Cntnap2 KO mice and WT controls exhibited robust rhythms in activity, although several parameters (total activity, power, amplitude) measured from the Cntnap2 KO mice were consistent with weaker rhythms as previously described (Wang et al., 2020). When treated with the short \u03bb enriched DLaN, the average waveform (1 hr bins) of both genotypes was significantly altered (Fig. 3A, B; Table 3) The WT and the Cntnap2 KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters while the long \u03bb enriched illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline (Fig. 3; Table 3). These differences in the effects of the short and long \u03bb illumination were strikingly evident when some of the key activity parameters were examined before and after treatment (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the negative effects of DLaN are driven by the spectral properties of the light used for illumination in both WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.\nReduced melanopic illumination prevents DLaN-driven disruption of social behavior in WT and Cntnap2 KO mice.\nDLaN reduced social behavior in both Cntnap2 KO mutants as well as WT controls (Wang et al., 2020), thus, here we sought to determine the influence of the lighting treatments using a reciprocal social interaction test.

We studied circadian reentrainment\nin AD model mice using a \u201cjet lag\u201d paradigm, observing their behavior\non a running wheel after a 6 h advance in the light:dark cycle. Female 3xTg mice,\nwhich carry mutations producing progressive amyloid beta and tau pathology,\nre-entrained following jet lag more rapidly than age-matched wild type controls\nat both 8 and 13 months of age. This re-entrainment phenotype has not been\npreviously reported in a murine AD model. Because microglia are activated\nin AD and in AD models, and inflammation can affect circadian rhythms, we\nhypothesized that microglia contribute to this re-entrainment phenotype. To test\nthis, we used the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX3397,\nwhich rapidly depletes microglia from the brain. Microglia depletion did not alter\nre-entrainment in either wild type or 3xTg mice, demonstrating that microglia\nactivation is not acutely responsible for the re-entrainment phenotype. To test\nwhether mutant tau pathology is necessary for this behavioral phenotype, we\nrepeated the jet lag behavioral test with the 5xFAD mouse model, which develops\namyloid plaques, but not neurofibrillary tangles. As with 3xTg mice, 7-monthold\nfemale 5xFAD mice re-entrained more rapidly than controls, demonstrating\nthat mutant tau is not necessary for the re-entrainment phenotype. Because AD\npathology affects the retina, we tested whether differences in light sensing may\ncontribute to altered entrainment behavior. 3xTg mice demonstrated heightened\nnegative masking, a circadian behavior measuring responses to different levels of\nlight, and re-entrained dramatically faster than WT mice in a jet lag experiment\nperformed in dim light. 3xTg mice show a heightened sensitivity to light as\na circadian cue that may contribute to accelerated photic re-entrainment.\nTogether, these experiments demonstrate novel circadian behavioral phenotypes\nwith heightened responses to photic cues in AD model mice which are not\ndependent on tauopathy or microglia.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, circadian behavior, jet lag, masking, amyloid beta, microglia, retina", "metadata": {"name": "Altered circadian behavior and light sensing in mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "page": 1, "pdf_id": "2adc961c-6913-45a2-bce5-5fd8aa504ffa"}, "id": "29"}, {"document": "time and treatment as factors, as well as the behavioral tests (Table 3) and the number of c-Fos+ cells (Table 4) with genotype and treatment as factors.

Differences were determined significant if P < 0.05.\nResults\nLong wavelength enriched illumination reduces negative masking, light-induced phase shifts of the circadian activity rhythm, and induction of c-Fos in the SCN of WT mice.\nIn these first set of experiments, we evaluated the influence of long and short \u03bb enhanced lighting (Fig. 1A) on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the circadian system in WT mice. The effects on light-driven masking of activity were measured with a passive infra-red activity assay. While the short wavelength enriched lights (10 lx, 60 min, ZT 14) elicited a significant reduction (51 \u00b1 5%) in masking behavior in the WT, the long wavelength illumination produced a low level of masking (14 \u00b1 7%) (Fig. 1B, Table 1). Next, we measured the impact of the two treatments on the light-induced phase shift of the circadian system using wheel-running activity (Fig. 1C). The WT mice were exposed to short- or long- wavelength lighting (10 lx, 15 min, CT 16) while activity was monitored in DD. The short-wavelength light triggered a significantly larger phase delay (-117 \u00b1 6 min) in the mice compared to the long-\u03bb (-26 \u00b1 4 min) (Fig. 1D, Table 1). Finally, we examined how the two lighting treatment (10 lx, 15 min, CT 16) affected the number of c-Fos immunopositive cells in the SCN (Fig. 1E). The SCN of the mice exposed to the shorter wavelength light exhibited a robust induction of c-Fos (94 \u00b1 6 cells per SCN section) whilst those exposed to the longer wavelength light had significantly fewer cells (19 \u00b1 2 per SCN section) (Fig. 1F, Table 1). Hence, shifting the spectral properties of light toward longer wavelength significantly reduced the effect of light on negative masking, light-induced phase shifts and light-induction of c-Fos in the SCN.\nMelanopsin (Opn4) expressing cells mediate the influence of DLaN on both activity cycles and social behavior.\nIt is well-established that the Opn4 expressing ipRGCs mediate the effects of light on the circadian system and we sought to test their role in mediating the behavioral impact of DLaN. Opn4DTA mice and their WT littermates were held under either LD control environment or the short \u03bb enriched DLaN for 2 weeks. While the WT mice exhibited a robust reduction in the strength of the activity rhythms (activity levels, power, amplitude) when exposed to the short \u03bb enriched DLaN, these parameters were unaltered in the mutant mice (Fig. 2A, B, Table 2).", "metadata": {"name": "Long wavelength light reduces the negative consequences of dim light at night in the Cntnap2 mouse model of autism.", "page": 10, "pdf_id": "8c4f75e5-13ff-4557-86d8-987327daba1a"}, "id": "76"}, {"document": "In the present study, we employed an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to generate dim illumination (10 lx) with a spectral composition that was enriched in either shorter wavelengths (\u03bb) designed to activate melanopsin or longer \u03bb designed to minimize activation of this photopigment.

Given\nthe variability between different AD models, our finding of the\nsame robust re-entrainment phenotype in two different models\nis important for validating that this phenotype is not the result\nof peculiarities of a specific genetic model. We do not observe\nalterations to free running period or daily activity patterns, two\nmeasures of circadian behavior in which differences have been\nreported in some studies with 3xTg mice (Wu et al., 2018; Adler\net al., 2019). Previous research has not found altered free running\nperiod in 5xFAD mice (Nagare et al., 2020), consistent with\nour findings here. We did observe notable differences between\nWT mice in our studies depending on age (Figures 1D, K)\nand strain (Figures 1D, 3D and Supplementary Figure 3C).\nIndeed, given the very rapid re-entrainment of littermate controls\nof PS19 mice, the B6C3 background strain in this model\nmay not be well-suited to detecting fine differences in reentrainment\nbehavior, and other tauopathy models may exhibit\nbehavioral differences. These heterogeneous results highlight the\nimportance of sex, age, and background strain in circadian\nbehavioral experiments.\nModulating neuroinflammation in AD is a promising field\nof research, and microglia can both contribute to and protect\nagainst disease progression. As neuroimmune activation and\ncircadian disruptions both appear early in the progression of\nAD, and inflammation can modulate circadian rhythms, microglia\nseemed a promising possible mechanism underlying circadian\nsymptoms. However, we found that microglia depletion did not\nrescue jet lag behavior in 3xTg mice. The microglia depletion\nin our experiment was acute and longer treatment may have\nother effects on circadian behavior, but our results suggest that\nacutely targeting inflammation in AD may not directly ameliorate\ncircadian disruptions. Retinal microglia are also likely not acutely\ninvolved in the jet lag phenotype as CSF1R inhibitors effectively\ndeplete microglia in the retina as well as in other regions of the\nbrain (Dharmarajan et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018).

Dysregulated circadian\nrhythmhas long-lasting effects on gutmicrobiota\n(Voigt et al. 2014). Interestingly, disturbances in the\ngut microbiome have also been associated with\ninsomnia and circadian misalignment (Parkar et al.\n2019; Pietruczuk et al. 2018). Diurnal oscillations of\ncomposition and function of gutmicrobiota have been\nreported. This has a substantial impact on metabolic\nhomeostasis and such diurnal variation of microbiota\ninfluences the host\u2019s circadian transcriptional as well\nas epigenetic oscillations. A recent study shows that\naltered microbiome rhythmicity has a deleterious\nimpact on normal chromatin and transcriptional oscillations\nand may also drive genome-wide de novo\noscillations (Thaiss et al. 2016).\nGut microbiota play pivotal roles in immune homeostasis\n(Wu and Wu 2012). A dysregulated gut microbiome may\nfuel inflammation, including neuroinflammation and also\naccelerate immune senescence (Hakansson and Molin\n2011). Such dysregulation has a profound impact on host\nphysiology and may also increase susceptibility to diseases,\nincluding neuropsychiatric illnesses (Nobs et al.\n2019; Petra et al. 2015). Contextually, gut microbiota\nalterations are increasingly being associated with ASD in\nrecent times (Dan et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2020). Thus,\ncircadian clock through modulation of gut microbiota\nmight dysregulate immune responses in ASD.\nCircadian rhythm, activation of oxidative\nstress pathway, and ASD risk\nCircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways are\nintimately involved in various physiological and signaling\nprocesses (Stangherlin and Reddy 2013). Under stressful\nconditions, the stress-regulatory system fails to maintain\nbalance between oxidants and anti oxidants and also alters\ncircadian timing processes. Impaired circadian rhythm and\noxidative stress pathways exert a number of adverse effects\nat cellular and organismal levels. Disrupted circadian\nrhythms and activated oxidative stress pathways alter\nneuronal processes as well as behaviors. This section is\naimed at discussing the functional interplay between\ncircadian rhythms and stress-regulatory pathways and its\npossible implications on ASD pathophysiology.\nOxidative stress toxicity reflects an imbalance between\noxidative stress and antioxidant defenses due to either\nexcessive formation of ROS, such as superoxide radicals\n(O2-), peroxides (ROOR), and hydroxyl radicals (OH-), or\ndisrupted redox defenses. A considerable body of evidence\nnow suggests that circadian rhythms have a significant\nimpact on the oxidative stress defense system (Wilking\net al. 2013). A circadian variation of the mediators of\noxidative stress pathway and rhythmic changes in oxidative\ndamage to DNA, protein, and lipid molecules have\nbeen demonstrated (Hardeland et al. 2003). CIRCADIAN\nCLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) acts as the master regulator\nof ROS homeostasis and plays a critical role in ROS mediated\noxidative stress responses (Lai et al. 2012). Also,\nseveral key enzymes and antioxidants such as superoxide\ndismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxins (Prx),\nglutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione disulfide\n(GSSG), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione\nS-reductase (GST), known to protect against free radicals\noscillate with circadian rhythmicity (Xu et al. 2012). An\nintricate connection exists between abnormal sleep\nrhythms and ROS generation (Blanco et al. 2007; Kanabrocki\net al. 2002). A recent study reported higher levels of\noxidative stress damage and lower levels of antioxidant\nresponses in night shift workers compared to day workers\n(Teixeira et al. 2019).\nGenes regulating oxidative stress are also influenced\nby circadian clock. Syrian hamsters exposed to continuous\nlight for two weeks had diminished expression of\nantioxidants like SOD, CAT, and GR compared to controls\n(Tomas-Zapico et al. 2003). Knockout studies of PER gene\nin mice showed that the production of SOD1 was linked to\nthe circadian rhythm and that rhythmicity was abolished\nin PER knockout mice (Jang et al. 2011). Mutations in the\nPER, REV-ERB\u03b1, CLOCK, or BMAL1 genes were shown to\nalter the production of antioxidants in the body\nsignificantly.\nIt is now evident that oxidative stress pathways are\nactivated in ASD (Bjorklund et al. 2020a).

We have previously shown that exposure to dim light at night (DLaN) in contactin associated protein-like 2 knock out (Cntnap2 KO) mice disrupts diurnal rhythms, increases repetitive behaviors while reducing social interactions. These negative effects of DLaN may be mediated by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to blue light (480nm). In this study, we used a light-emitting diode (LED) array that enabled us to shift the spectral properties of the DLaN while keeping the intensity at 10 lx. First, using wild-type (WT) mice, we confirmed that the short-wavelength enriched lighting produced strong acute suppression of locomotor activity (masking), robust light-induced phase shifts, and c-Fos expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, while the long-wavelength enriched lighting evoked much weaker responses. Furthermore, exposure of WT mice to the short-wavelength light at night reduced the amplitude of locomotor activity rhythms and impaired social interactions. Mice lacking the melanopsin expressing ipRGCs (Opn4DTA mice) were resistant to these negative effects of DLaN. Importantly, the shift of the DLaN stimulus to longer wavelengths ameliorated the negative impact on the activity rhythms and autistic behaviors (i.e. reciprocal social interactions, repetitive grooming) of the Cntnap2 KO model. The short-, but not the long-wavelength enriched, DLaN triggered cFos expression in the peri-habenula region as well as in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Finally, DLaN-driven c-Fos induction in BLA glutamatergic neurons was about 3-fold higher in the Cntnap2 KO mice, suggesting that these cells may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of photic disruption. Broadly, our findings suggest that the spectral properties of light at night should be considered in the management of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.\nKeywords: Autism spectrum disorder, amygdala, c-Fos, circadian, Cntnap2 knock out, light pollution, melanopsin, mice\nAbbreviations: analysis of variance, ANOVA; autism spectrum disorders, ASD; constant darkness, DD; contactin associated protein-like 2 knock out, Cntnap2 KO; dim light at night, DLaN; intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, ipRGCs; light:dark, LD; standard error of the mean, SEM; suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN; wavelength, \u03bb; wild-type, WT; Zeitgeber Time, ZT", "metadata": {"name": "Long wavelength light reduces the negative consequences of dim light at night in the Cntnap2 mouse model of autism.", "page": 2, "pdf_id": "8c4f75e5-13ff-4557-86d8-987327daba1a"}, "id": "68"}, {"document": "Fig. 1: Shift to longer wavelength illumination reduces negative masking, light-induced phase shifts of the circadian activity rhythms, and induction of c-Fos in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of WT mice.

We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to disrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice (Fig. 2).

Both lines of mice exhibited a significant reduction in a number of activity rhythm parameters when exposed to the high melanopic illumination while the low melanopic illumination did not produce significant changes compared to baseline (Fig. 3, 4). Similarly, exposure to high melanopic illumination disrupted social behavior in both genotypes while the low melanopic DLaN had little effect on social interactions (Fig. 5). Finally, we found that exposure to high melanopic illumination increased repetitive grooming in the Cntnap2 KO but not the low melanopic DLaN (Fig. 6). Together, these data show that minimizing the melanopic activation of the light source was an effective strategy to minimize the negative effects of night-time light exposure.\nThere is a strong male bias in ASD prevalence with a common reported ratio of \u223c4:1 (Fombonne, 2009) and there is evidence for significant interactions between sex and genotype in the Cntnap2 gene in human populations (e.g. Hsu et al., 2019). Some of these sex differences may be driven in part by male/female differences in phenotypic presentation, including fewer repetitive behaviors in females (e.g. Werling and Geschwind, 2013). On the other hand, sleep disturbances appear to be more common in female with ASD (Elkhatib Smidt et al., 2021). Prior work with the Cntnap2 KO mouse model found clear evidence for a sex difference with home cage activity with robust hypo-activity in the males but not in the female mutants (Angelakos et al., 2019). In addition, the functional responses of cortical circuitry in male mice are more strongly affected by Cntnap2 mutations than females (Townsend and Smith, 2017). Therefore, we powered the activity analysis to be able to examine possible sex differences in activity rhythms. Sex differences could be observed in the activity rhythms in WT mice that were lost in the Cntnap2 KO line (Table 4; S. Fig. 1). We did see evidence that the excessive grooming, a measure of repetitive behavior, was more pronounced in the mutant males than in the females, although both sexes showed significantly higher grooming than age and sex-matched WT. Social deficits were observed in mutants of both sexes. Hence, both sexes of Cntnap2 KO exhibited phenotypes of disrupted activity rhythms, higher repetitive behavior and less social interactions compared to WT mice. Interestingly, prior work has found that LPS-induced maternal immune activation caused male-specific deficits in behavior and gene expression in the Cntnap2 KO line (Schaafsma et al., 2017). Furthermore, we asked whether the female mice might be less influenced by the environmental challenge caused by DLaN treatment. In our three assays (activity, grooming, and social interactions), we found that both sexes were negatively impacted by the DLaN (Table 5; S. Fig. 2). The females Cntnap2 KO did appear to be relatively resistant to the excessive grooming triggered by DLaN. Still overall our data demonstrate that the both sexes were negatively impacted by the Cntnap2 mutation and the negative influence of DLaN.", "metadata": {"name": "Long wavelength light reduces the negative consequences of dim light at night in the Cntnap2 mouse model of autism.", "page": 15, "pdf_id": "8c4f75e5-13ff-4557-86d8-987327daba1a"}, "id": "81"}, {"document": "Introduction\nDim light at night (DLaN) is a common environmental perturbation of the circadian timing system and has been linked to a range of negative consequences (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017). Prior work in pre-clinical models has demonstrated that light at night negatively impacts the metabolism (Fonken et al., 2013a; Plano et al., 2017), immune function (Bedrosian et al., 2011; Fonken et al., 2013b; Lucassen et al., 2016), mood and cognition (Lazzerini Ospri et al., 2017; An et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020). Individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) commonly experience disturbances in their circadian rhythms, and commonly find difficulty in both falling asleep as well as sleeping through the night (Cohen et al., 2014; Devnani and Hegde, 2015; Mazurek and Sohl, 2016; Baker and Richdale, 2017; Shelton and Malow, 2021). Perhaps because of this difficulty sleeping at night, ASD patients spend more time exposed to the electronic screens at night compared with age-matched controls (Engelhardt et al., 2013; Stiller et al., 2019; Healy et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021). It has been speculated that this exposure to DLaN via screens and other lighting sources could be detrimental to ASD populations. In support of this speculation, we previously reported that an animal model with a genetic risk factor associated with ASD (contactin associated protein-like 2, Cntnap2) shows reduced social preference and increased stereotypic grooming behavior after a 2-week exposure to DLaN (Wang et al., 2020).\nThe negative effects of nightly light exposure could be mediated by the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to shorter wavelengths (\u03bb) of light with a peak response to 480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). In addition, ipRGCs receive inputs from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2002; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021) with the rods driving the circadian response to sensitivity to low-intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010). These findings indicate that the circadian system is sensitive to broad spectrum of light (Foster et al., 2020), and raise the question of whether changes in the spectral properties of DLaN matter. Perhaps the intensity of the night-time illumination is the only parameter that is biologically important? In fact, recent studies are beginning to address the issue of whether adjusting the spectral composition of light to reduce melanopic stimulation can be used as a strategy to minimize disruption of circadian rhythms (Gladanac et al., 2019; Nagare et al., 2019; Figueiro and Pedler, 2020; Mouland et al., 2021; Vethe et al., 2021).", "metadata": {"name": "Long wavelength light reduces the negative consequences of dim light at night in the Cntnap2 mouse model of autism.", "page": 3, "pdf_id": "8c4f75e5-13ff-4557-86d8-987327daba1a"}, "id": "69"}, {"document": "a\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\n0\n10\n20\n0 5 10\nDAPI intensity (a.u.)\nTime (min)\n0\n10\n20\n0 5 10\nDAPI intensity (a.u.)\nTime (min)\n0\n10\n20\n0 5 10\nDAPI intensity (a.u.)\nTime (min)\n0\n10\n20\n0 5 10\nDAPI intensity (a.u.)\nTime (min)\nDiD + L DiD Cy5-amine + L Cy5-amine Cy5.5-amine + L Cy5.5-amine\n0\n10\n20\n0 5 10\nDAPI intensity (a.u.)\nTime (min)\n0\n10\n20\n0 5 10\nDAPI intensity (a.u.)\nTime (min)\nFig. 4 | Cell membrane permeabilization of A375 cells over time.

Strategies for managing sundowning and\nimproving sleep-related symptoms in AD patients include\nmaintaining strict light schedules, increasing exposure to intense\nlight during daylight hours, and decreasing exposure to light during\nthe night (Mitolo et al., 2018). AD patients also have decreased\namplitude of rhythmic circadian gene expression (Cermakian et al.,\n2011). This may indicate a weak biological circadian clock, making\nthem heavily dependent on external cues for its maintenance.\nRapid re-entrainment may indicate a decrease in the coupling and\nsynchrony of neurons in the SCN, resulting in an intrinsic circadian\ntimekeeper less resistant to being shifted by misaligned photic\nentrainment cues. A very similar jet lag phenotype is observed in\nmice genetically knocked out for vasopressin signaling (Yamaguchi\net al., 2013), which impairs interneuronal communication in the\nSCN. Some reports find decreased AVP expression in the SCN\nof AD patients (Liu et al., 2000; Harper et al., 2008), though this\nhas been disputed (Wang et al., 2015), and previous reports have\nfound decreased expression of AVP in the SCN of 3xTg mice\n(Sterniczuk et al., 2010). Further studies will be needed to determine\nif changes in SCN signaling also contribute to this phenotype and\nhow amyloid pathology drives those changes.\nOur finding of increased sensitivity to low-intensity photic\ncircadian cues in an AD model suggests mechanisms outside the\nSCN may play a role in the jet lag phenotype. A previous study\nfound increased negative masking in male 3xTg mice (Gonz\u00e1lez-\nLuna et al., 2021) but did not examine behavior at low light\nlevels. The retinal degeneration in AD models, including 3xTg\nmice (Grimaldi et al., 2018), and ipRGC loss in AD (La Morgia\net al., 2016) suggest decreased sensitivity, not increased. The limited\nresearch on visual ability in 3xTg mice has not reported deficits\n(King et al., 2018), while some decrease in RGC activity can\nbe observed by electroretinography (Frame et al., 2022). Recent\nresearch found a loss of ipRGCs and decreased ipRGC projections\nto the SCN in the APP/PS1 model (Carrero et al., 2023). Our\nfinding in 3xTg mice of heightened responses to photic cues in\ntwo circadian behavioral paradigms, as well as increased ipRGC\ndensity, runs contrary to these findings and suggests that in some\nmodels, or at some stages of disease progression, ipRGC signaling\nmay be increased rather than decreased. Indeed, while human data\nshow a decrease in ipRGCs in postmortem AD retinas (La Morgia\net al., 2016), another study did not find deficits in the pupillary light\nreflex, an ipRGC-dependent task, in pre-symptomatic AD subjects\n(Oh et al., 2019). Thus the reported decline in ipRGC number in\nAD may be specific to disease stage. More research will be necessary\nto determine the causes of differences between disease stages. Some\nevidence suggests that ipRGC number declines with age in mice\n(Semo et al., 2003) and humans (La Morgia et al., 2010), which\nmay slow re-entrainment in aged WT mice. ipRGC density in\n3xTg retinas over aging should be studied to determine whether\nthis decline is modified and whether that may contribute to the\nobserved increased ipRGC count at 13 months. The heterogeneity\nof the ipRGC population should also be further studied in these\nmice. Some ipRGC subtypes express melanopsin at very low levels\nand would be undetectable by the IHC technique used here. One\npossible explanation for the increase in melanopsin + cells in the\n3xTg retinas could be an increase in melanopsin expression in\nnon-M1 ipRGCs, or a skew toward more M1 and M2 ipRGCs,\nrather than an increase in the number of the ipRGC population.\nAs these non-M1 ipRGCs have different functions and projection\npatterns than M1 ipRGCs [reviewed in Do (2019)], such a change\nin the ipRGC population could have consequences for diverse visual\ncircuits and behaviors.\nIn summary, we demonstrate that AD model mice exhibit\nstrikingly altered circadian behavior, suggesting a heightened\nsensitivity to photic circadian cues. This appears to be driven\nby pathogenic Ab and does not require the presence of\nmicroglia or mutant tau.\nMaterials and methods\nMice\nAll animal experiments were conducted in accordance with\nthe University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee.

Some populations may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of the exposure of light at night. For example, in the Cntnap2 KO mouse model of ASD, we have found that DLaN selectively increases repetitive behavior as measured by grooming while WT mice were not impacted (Wang et al., 2020). On the other hand, DLaN negatively impacted other behaviors including social interactions and daily activity rhythms in both the Cntnap2 KO and WT mice. In the present study, we confirmed these negative effects of nocturnal lighting on activity rhythms, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors (Table 3). Logically, the simplest approach to reducing these negative effects would solely be to decrease light intensity at night while ensuring a robust exposure to sunlight during the day. However, according to surveys, people spend a majority of time indoors (as high as 90%) and have need for illumination after the sun sets (e.g. Klepeis et al., 2001). Therefore an appealing alternative approach would be to adjust the spectral quality of indoor lighting to minimize the negative effects. As a test case, in the present study, we used an array of LEDs to generate dim illumination (10 lx) to determine whether the spectral composition of nightly illumination would make a difference in the Cntnap2 KO model of autism.\nThe retinal photoreceptor system has unique intensity and wavelength dependent characteristics (Lucas et al., 2014). The negative effects of nightly light exposure are likely to be mediated by ipRGCs expressing the photopigment melanopsin, which is maximally sensitive to light with a peak response to \u2248480nm light (Hattar et al., 2002; Panda et al., 2005). Indeed a number of studies have found evidence that short \u03bb enriched lighting is more effective for circadian responses (for review see Brown, 2020). However, recent work emphasizes that ipRGCs also receive input from rod and cone photoreceptors (Hattar et al., 2003; Lucas et al., 2012; Van Diepen et al., 2021; Schoonderwoerd et al., 2022) with rods driving the circadian response to low-intensity light (Altimus et al., 2010; Lall et al 2010) like the 10 lx used in the present study. Here we used an LED lighting system (Korrus Inc.) to tailor the spectral properties of the DLaN with the goal of manipulating melanopic stimulation. The output of the LEDs was measured as power over a defined wavelength (380-780nm) using a spectrophotometer. This data was analysed using a CIE toolkit which enabled us to estimate that the short \u03bb illumination was at 15 melanopic lx while the long \u03bb illumination was 1 melanopic lx while maintaining illuminance at \u224810 lx.\nUsing these two lighting treatments with predicted high and low melanopic stimulation, we measured the impact of the illumination on three classic tests of the ipRGC input to the circadian system (Fig. 1). We demonstrated that the low melanopic stimulation reduced the effect of light on negative masking, light-induced phase shifts and light-induction of c-Fos in the SCN. Next, we examined the influence of the high melanopic illumination on activity and social behavior of WT and Opn4DTA in which the ipRGCs are lost due to targeted diphtheria toxin expression. We found that the high melanopic illumination showed greatly diminished ability to disrupt activity rhythms including negative masking as well as alter social behavior in the mutant mice (Fig. 2).

Evidence further supported this by comparing\na strong MJH Cy7.5-amine with a weak MJH Cy7-amine,\nwhich has a higher molar extinction than Cy7.5-amine. Cy7-\namine was much less efficient than Cy7.5-amine in opening cell\nmembranes. The same behavior was observed in the comparison\nbetween a strong MJH Cy5.5-amine versus a weak MJH Cy5-\namine. Regarding the photochemical reactions, we distinguished\nthese effects from mechanical action by comparing the best MJH\n(Cy7.5-amine) with a cyanine molecule DiR (a lipophilic, nearinfrared\nfluorescent cyanine dye), but a weak MJH that produced\n\u224820-fold higher concentrations of ROS, yet it did not permeabilize\nthe cells.We further isolated the mechanical action from the\nROS effects by studying MJH action on oxidation-resistant synthetic\ngiant lipid vesicles and showed the stepwise mechanical\nopening.\nCyanine dye ICG has been reported as a photothermal and\nphotodynamic agent to cause slow apoptotic cell death through\noxidative stress.[25] In contrast, VDA of cell-associated MJH results\nin rapid necrosis (cell membrane disruption) within minutes.\nWe showed that the photothermal effects of ICG start playing\na role at concentrations above 8 \u03bcM where it causes a 1 \u00b0C\ntemperature increase.

Results and Discussion\n2.1. Building a Molecular Plasmon Library of Small Organic\nMolecules\nMJH supports plasmon resonances in small organic molecules\nupon optical excitation. Here, four major resonances in cyaninebased\nmolecular plasmons have been identified and proposed,\nsupported by the induced charge density plots from density functional\ntheory calculations in our recent work (Figure 1).[23] Two\nplasmon resonances are in the blue region of the visible spectrum\nand two are in the NIR region. These four plasmon resonances\ncorrespond to: 1) the dipolar oscillation of the electron\ndensity along the longitudinal axis of the molecule, called the\nlongitudinal molecular plasmon (LMP); 2) the quadrupolar oscillation\nof electron density, primarily along the longitudinal axis\nand coupled with contributions along the transversal axis; 3) a\nquadrupolar oscillation of electron density, primarily along the\ntransversal axis and coupled with contributions along the longitudinal\naxis; and 4) a dipolar oscillation of the electron density\nalong the transverse axis, called the transversal molecular\nplasmon (TMP), as described in Figure 1A,B. A pictorial representation\nof the proposed mechanism of MJH to open cellular\nmembranes upon NIR-light excitation is shown in Figure 1C,D.\nThe optical excitation of plasmon resonances in MJH activates\nthe electron density oscillations that simultaneously coupled\nwith the nuclear vibrations, giving rise to VDA that can disassemble\ncellularmembranes or supramolecular biological assemblies.\nThe MJH associates with the lipid bilayers through hydrophobic\nand electrostatic interactions between the nonpolar\nportions and the polar substituents on the MJH, respectively. The\nphospholipids include phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine,\nphosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol, or cardiolipin, the latter\nshown in Figure 1D. Various molecules were synthesized\nby: 1) modifying the side chain that contributes to binding into\nlipid bilayers (Figure 1E); and 2) modifying the chemical structure\nof the conjugated core that strongly contributes to the plasmon\nresonance properties (Figure 1F\u2013H). Following this strategy,\na comprehensive library of MJH compounds was synthesized\n(Figure 2).\n2.2. The Molecular Plasmonicity Index Correlates with the Cell\nMembranes Opening Activity\nThe activity of plasmon-driven MJHs to open cell membranes\nby VDA upon NIR light activation was evaluated in\nhuman melanoma A375 cells. When the cell membranes were\nopened by VDA, 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), a bluefluorescent\ndye that predominantly enters the cell when the lipid\nmembrane is compromised, immediately stains the nucleus.\nFlow cytometry analysis was used to quantify the percentage of\nDAPI-positive cells at variable concentrations of MJH (Figures\nS1\u2013S9, Supporting Information). The flow cytometry analysis\nwas conducted immediately after the cells were treated with\n730 nm LED light at 80 mW cm\u22122 for 10 min. Typically, it\ntook \u224830 s to start cell counting and observe that DAPI had\nalready entered the cell membrane-compromised cells but had\nnot entered cells in the controls that did not have VDA. This is\nindicative of a rapid necrotic cell death and DAPI cell membrane\npermeabilization by VDA. The effective concentration needed to\npermeabilize 50% of the cells (VDA IC50) was estimated for each\nmolecule (Figures S10,S11, Supporting Information). To clarify,\nthis method quantifies the opening of the plasma membrane\nsince this is the physical layer through which DAPI enters the\ncell.

Melatonin production in ASD subjects: A) The regular nocturnal synthesis of melatonin, observed in individuals with normal-development, occurs\nbased on the nocturnal release of norepinephrine directly into the pineal gland at darkness. Activation of beta 1- adrenoceptors (\u03b21-AR) activates the intracellular\ncascade of the protein kinase A (PKA), a family of enzymes whose activity is dependent on the cellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP), and the cAMP\nresponse element-binding protein (CREB), a nuclear transcription factor that induces the expression of the enzyme aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase\n(AANAT). The gene coding for acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) is thought to be constitutively expressed in the pinealocytes. Thus, by a two-step\nenzymatic action, the serotonin (5-HT) levels in the pinealocytes are readily metabolized by AANAT to produce N-acetylserotonin (NAS) which is readily\nmethylated by ASMT to form melatonin. Because melatonin is highly amphiphilic, it flows through the pineal gland recess to reach the cerebrospinal fluid and\nthe circulation as means of the pineal gland activity. Activation of the immune-pineal axis was shown to be a major regulator of the transcription, and protein\navailability, of the enzyme AANAT. ASD individuals present high levels of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor, which is correlated with the reduced production\nof melatonin. On the other hand, single-nucleotide polymorphisms were also described for the gene coding for ASMT in ASD subjects. B) individuals\nwith normal-development present a high urinary excretion levels of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (a6MTs), suggesting a high fidedignity between the nocturnal production\nand excretion of melatonin metabolites (blue lines). Conversely, a6MTs levels in ASD is reduced (red lines) or even a phase-shifted excretion levels,\nsuggesting that reduction of the nocturnal melatonin is impaired. Indeed, a6MTS rhythmic alterations were correlated with the activation of the immune-pineal\naxis.

In pre-, and\nearly- post-natal period, a critical phase of plasticity in the cortex\nwidely contribute for allowance of neurodevelopmental disorders.\nThis is known when the failure in coordinate maturation of neurons,\nby changes in timed clock gene oscillation in the SCN [53] as well\nas by deficits in circulating melatonin levels [186] which reinforces\nthe need for understanding the effects and the signals transduced by\nmelatonin in this areas in other to prevent or surpass the intrauterine\nor post-natal challenges in the neurodevelopment of ASD,\nwhich may find in the analysis of TNF/melatonin correlation, a\nmathematical model for early assessing changes observed in lateinfancy\nalterations observed in our population of ASD patients.\nThus, by detecting changes in melatonin rhythm in the early development\ndue to increased TNF, for example, would provide further\ntools for assessing the beneficial pharmacological roles of melatonin\nin the control and management of sleep disorders observed in\nASD subjects.\nAltogether, our data reinforce that melatonin disruption in ASD\nsubjects may interfere with sleep as a result of a previous proinflammatory\nphenotype. Also, increased inflammation could be\nalso responsible for the malfunction of the SCN-driven desynchronization,\nwhich would also affect the circulating melatonin levels.\nThis hypothesis could be the basis for understanding why melatonin\ntherapy was shown to improve sleep quality, as well as several\nother aspects of behavior in ASD [26, 155]. From the earliest studies\ntesting the efficacy of melatonin in ASD [119, 157, 187] all\nsleep parameters (sleep latency, waking per night, total sleep duration)\nare improved after treatment with melatonin subsequently\nimproving behavior in the children and caregivers\u2019 quality of life\n[20, 26, 119, 155, 188].\nThe current practice holds that behavioral interventions including\nsleep hygiene, should be the first-line approach for treating\nsleep problems [188]. Indeed, there is a strong consensus among\nresearchers that exogenous melatonin is beneficial and safe for\ntreating chronic sleep disorders in ASD children [119, 161, 188,\n189].

Cancer cells show an altered energy\nmetabolism, using glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy,\nknown as the Warburg effect [80]. In multiple tissue types, components of both\nmitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and of glycolysis show daily rhythms\n[11]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythm in nutrient availability also modulates glycolytic\npathway and mitochondria [22]. Therefore, for cancer cells to adapt a different\nenergy metabolism strategy, the circadian rhythm regulation of metabolism must be\ndisrupted. Similarly, some cancers become increasingly dependent on autophagy to\nrecycle their cellular constituents, and many circadian clock components directly or\nindirectly regulate autophagy. Circadian expression of C/EBP beta [81], a potent\nactivator of autophagy, and Rev-erb regulation of autophagy gene expression in the\nliver offer a temporal regulatory mechanism for autophagy [44]. Therefore, similar\nto energy metabolism, the cancer cells addiction to autophagy must override the\ncircadian regulation of autophagy.\n21.4.5 Obesity, Diabetes, Insulin Resistance\nAssociation between disruption of circadian timekeeping and risk of metabolic\nsyndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes has been extensively established [82]. Obesity,\ndiabetes, and insulin resistance maintain close cause and effect relationships.\nBMAL knockout mice show reduced insulin and lack rhythmicity in insulin activity.\nWhen rhythmicity is rescued via expression of BMAL2, insulin action and\nactivity is restored. Mice whose circadian function has been compromised \u2013 either\nvia BMAL knockout or WT exposure to constant light \u2013 are more obese-prone\nwhen on a high-fat diet than normal controls [82]. In humans, circadian disruption\nmay increase diabetes risk via inflammatory mechanisms independent of sleep loss,\nleading to decreased insulin sensitivity without compensatory increase in insulin\nsecretion [83].\n21.5 Relevance of Circadian-Eating Pattern Interactions\nGiven the extensive reciprocal interaction between circadian oscillator and metabolic\nregulators, simple change in daily eating pattern will likely perturb the\ntemporal regulation of metabolic homeostasis and result in altered body composition,\nweight gain, and metabolic diseases. Experimental results in both animals and\nhumans support this notion. Laboratory male mice typically consume a major\nportion of their daily diet during the dark phase of the light-dark cycle.

Felix-Ortiz and Tye (2014) used optogenetic approaches to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays, and showed that the excited BLA/mPFC microcircuit reduced social interaction whereas suppression favoured social behavior. Sun and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that the glutamatergic neurons from the BLA preferentially projected to GABAergic neurons in the mPFC. Both their optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulations of this pathway resulted in reduced mPFC activity and stereotypic behavior. The ventral hippocampus (vHp) is the second downstream target. When the glutamatergic projection from the BLA to the vHp mice was activated, social interaction was reduced while the self-grooming was increased. This glutamatergic BLA/vHp pathway was further confirmed by the finding that glutamate receptor antagonists delivered to the vHPC attenuated optogenetic-evoked behavioral changes (Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014). Therefore, we speculate that the DLaN driven activation of the glutamatergic cell population in the BLA (Table 7) is what drives the grooming behavior observed in the present study.\nWith rapidly growing studies reporting the effects of lights on not only circadian rhythms but also the brain health (Stevenson et al., 2015; Lunn et al., 2017; Bumgarner and Nelson, 2021), the consequences of worldwide prevalence of DLaN should be taken into concern of disease management seriously, especially to those patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases who are vulnerable to environmental perturbations. Many people send the majority of time inside under artificial lighting, their exposure to DLaN needs to be carefully considered. Inappropriate light at night is common in hospitals, long-term care centers, and even our homes (Fournier and Wirz-Justice, 2010; Burgess and Molina, 2014; Osibona et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021). Thus, nightly light pollution is a very common environmental disruption to our circadian rhythms all over the world, and this present study shows that the undesired outcomes of DLaN on sleep/wake cycles and autistic behavior can be lessened by tailoring the spectral content of light sources to minimize melanopic stimulation.\nAcknowledgments: We would like to acknowledge UCLA students Kyle Nguyen-Ngo and Kelly Yun who helped with the scoring of some of the fluorescence staining.

The circadian clock machinery is also\ncritically involved in regulating and fine-tuning neurodevelopmental\nprocesses. Circadian disruption during\nembryonic development can impair crucial phases of neurodevelopment.\nThis can contribute to neurodevelopmental\ndisorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the\noffspring. Increasing evidence from studies showing\nabnormalities in sleep and melatonin as well as genetic and\nepigenetic changes in the core elements of the circadian\npathway indicate a pivotal role of circadian disruption in\nASD. However, the underlying mechanistic basis through\nwhich the circadian pathways influence the risk and\nprogression of ASD are yet to be fully discerned. Wellrecognized\nmechanistic pathways in ASD include altered\nimmune-inflammatory, nitro oxidative stress, neurotransmission\nand synaptic plasticity, and metabolic pathways.\nNotably, all these pathways are under the control of the\ncircadian clock. It is thus likely that a disrupted circadian\nclock will affect the functioning of these pathways. Herein,\nwe highlight the possible mechanisms through which\naberrations in the circadian clock might affect immuneinflammatory,\nnitro-oxidative, metabolic pathways, and\nneurotransmission, thereby driving the neurobiological\nsequelae leading to ASD.\nKeywords: autism; circadian rhythm; neurodevelopmental;\nneuro-immune; neurotransmitter; oxidative\nstress.\nIntroduction\nCircadian rhythms are the 24 h cycles of biological\nrhythms involving physiological, mental, and behavioral\nvariations. They are mostly influenced by light and dark\nstimuli. Circadian rhythms control almost all vital physiological\nandmetabolic processes through the sleep\u2013wake\ncycle. Endogenous circadian rhythms train and synchronize\nwith environmental cycles. Misaligned environmental\ncycles and endogenous biological rhythms have\ndeleterious consequences on human health. Multiple\nstudies have demonstrated a link between circadian\ndisruption and adverse mental health outcomes, predominantly\nmood disorders such as major depressive\ndisorder and bipolar disorder (Lyall et al. 2018; Matson\nand Nebel-Schwalm 2007; Walker et al. 2020). Besides\nthis, there is an essential role of circadian rhythm in", "metadata": {"name": "Disruption of circadian rhythm and risk of autism spectrum disorder: role of immune-inflammatory, oxidative stress, metabolic and neurotransmitter pathways", "page": 1, "pdf_id": "eac9624b-65fe-412f-b7ab-f9ea82581e16"}, "id": "50"}, {"document": "Cy5-amine, showed similar behaviour. These results suggest that there\nis a correlation between molecular structure and the VDA intensity of\nthe molecular mechanical action (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2). The\nVDA increases with the length of the conjugation in the polymethine\nbridge and the extension of the aromatic ring at the indoles (Extended\nData Fig. 2).\nUsing confocal microscopy, we monitored over time the permeabilization\nof the cells mediated by Cy5.5-amine and Cy5-amine\nfollowing treatment with 640 nm light (Fig. 4); at this wavelength, the\nvibronic band in Cy5.5-amine is accessed, but it is only weakly accessed\nin Cy5-amine (Fig. 3a). In addition, the cell-membrane-targeting\n1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) (DiD) dye\nwas used as a control. In the case of Cy5.5-amine, the cells were already\npermeabilized 4 min after laser excitation; the DAPI intensity (cell permeabilization)\nwas 2-fold higher than the initial intensity and 13-fold\nhigher at 10 min. This result shows that Cy5.5-amine is a stronger MJH\nthan Cy5-amine (2.5-fold DAPI intensity increase at 10 min), which is\nconsistent with the flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b\u2013d). The DiD dye\nshowed a weak effect on cell permeabilization (1.5-fold DAPI intensity\nincrease at 10 min), as expected because it is similar to Cy5, an MJH with\na weak VDA. In all of the non-illuminated controls, the DAPI intensity\nremained unchanged at 10 min relative to the initial intensity. The fluorescence\nof DiD was observed to weaken upon light irradiation (Fig. 4f).\nIt is known that cyanines photoisomerize to produce non-emissive dark\nstates, including photoisomers and triplet states26. The triplet states of\na chromophore can be populated via intersystem crossing and promote\nenergy transfer to generate singlet oxygen24,25,32. These factors might\noperate in DiD, resulting in delayed fluorescence emission, a potent\nphotosensitizer and a weak MJH (Fig. 4f). This is further confirmed and\ndiscussed later using 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindotricar\nbocyanine iodide (DiR iodide). The presence of heavy atoms such as\niodide enhances the generation of triplet states, leading to strong photosensitizers24,25.\nTherefore, DiD and DiR iodide are suitable controls to\nshow that strong photosensitizers are less efficient in permeabilizing\nthe cells.\nDistinguishing mechanical action from photothermal and\nphotodynamic effects\nTo rule out a photothermal effect, the temperature of the media\nwas measured during the exposure of an A375 cell suspension with\nCy7.5-amine to NIR light both at room temperature and in an ice bath\n(Extended Data Fig. 6). The temperature remained constant at 20 and\n2 \u00b0C, respectively, for both treatments. The cell permeabilization was\nalso unaffected by the lower temperature (Extended Data Fig. 6g).\nThus, a photothermal effect is not responsible for the necrosis seen\nin these cells.\nTo confirm that photodynamic ROS generation is not responsible\nfor the necrosis, the permeabilization of A375 melanoma cells\nwas repeated in the presence of ROS scavengers (Extended Data\nFig. 7a\u2013c). We observed that N-acetylcysteine (10 mM), thiourea\n(100 mM) nor sodium azide (2.5 mM) retarded the permeabilization\nof the cells. Furthermore, we determined that ROS are not responsible\nfor the permeabilization of the cells by lowering the illumination time\nof the permeabilization study, when the scavengers might quench ROS\nmore effectively (Extended Data Fig. 7d). The results show that none\nof the ROS scavengers used (N-acetylcysteine, thiourea, sodium azide,\nmethionine or vitamin C) slowed the permeabilization of the A375 cells,\nsuggesting that ROS are not responsible for the permeabilization of the\ncells. Extended Data Fig. 8 shows that singlet oxygen production is also\nnot responsible for the permeabilization of the cells.\nTo confirm that the cells permeabilized to DAPI are indeed dead,\nwe cultured the cells after treatment (with 2 \u03bcM Cy7.5-amine and illumination\nfor 10 min with 730 nm light at 80 mW cm\u22122) and quantified\ncell death by crystal violet and clonogenic assays. Extended Data\nFig. 9 shows that nearly the same quantity of cells permeabilized by\nlight-activated Cy7.5-amine were dead, 99.9%, as was observed by flow\ncytometry (Fig. 2). The clonogenic assay showed that 100% of the cells\nwere eradicated when using 0.5 \u03bcM Cy7.5-amine and illumination for\n10 min with 730 nm light at 80 mW cm\u22122.\nThe Food and Drug Administration-approved indocyanine green\n(ICG) bearing alkylsulfonate addends was also studied. ICG has a\nvibronic absorption shoulder at 730 nm (Supplementary Fig. 4), and\nthe sulfonates will not interact with phospholipids in the lipid bilayers.\nICG did not permeabilize the cells under the same conditions in which\nCy7.5-amine was tested. Taken together, this suggests that the effective\ncell killing of Cy7.5-amine is a synergistic effect of the amine pendant\nfor rapid cell association followed by VDA. This presumably causes\nenergy transfer from these whole-molecule-excited structures to the\ncellular membrane, ultimately disrupting the lipid bilayer, permitting\ncell membrane permeabilization.\nMechanism of mechanical cell membrane disruption\nWe also studied the mechanism of action of MJHs by mechanical disruption\nof lipid bilayers in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs; Extended Data\nFig. 10).

The contribution of genetic\nvariations in the clock genes or melatonin synthesis enzymes to\nmelatonin deficiency is presented in only a small percentage of\nindividuals with ASD and have not notable impacts on sleep problems\n[161, 162].\nIn our recent study [153] urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s)\nexcretion, a melatonin metabolite that directly correlates with melatonin\nsynthesis by the pineal gland, was arrhythmic in 40% of ASD\nindividuals, suggesting a decrease in the nocturnal synthesis of\nmelatonin in this population. We also observed a different pattern\nof melatonin excretion in the other 60% of the population analyzed:\nsome presented a daily rhythmic variation of aMT6s excretion,\nsimilar to control subjects, and others showed a clear disruption in\nthe rhythm (i.e., nocturnal decreased aMT6s excretion or increased\nat the daytime level compared with control subjects).\nThus, besides SNPs mutation in ASMT seems to be a useful\ntool for addressing a rationale for decreased melatonin levels in\nASD individuals, it has become relevant to evaluate the activation\nof the immune-pineal axis, which was described for acute inflammatory\nresponse in challenging the activity of the pineal gland for\nproducing melatonin at night [64, 163] and now it is considered\nhighly relevant in the orchestration and maintenance of the quiescence\nof immune responses, as absence or presence of TNF levels\nin humans became a hallmark for reducing the levels of melatonin\nin acute [164] or chronic inflammatory responses [153, 165]. By\nevaluating TNF levels in the saliva and the aMT6s levels excreted\nin the urine of control and ASD individuals, our study assessed the\nrelationship between altered melatonin synthesis and the increased\nlevels of the inflammatory cytokine TNF, known to be one relevant\ncytokine involved in sleep disorders in ASD subjects (Fig. 2). High\nlevels of TNF have already been detected in plasma [101] and brain\n[166] of individuals with ASD. Under normal neurodevelopmental\nconditions, TNF plays a physiological role in controlling apoptosis,\nneurogenesis, and neuronal cell differentiation [167], which is the\nbiological basis for the development of cognition [168]. Increased\nlevels of TNF result in abnormalities in neural connectivity as well\nas deficits in the processing information and social interaction\n[168]. In rodent models, activation of TNF receptors in pinealocytes\nleads to translocation of the NF-\u03baB p50/p50 subunit, which inhibits\nAanat coding gene expression [169]. Our recent study confirmed\nthat in ASD there is an inverse correlation between melatonin and\nTNF levels, suggesting the relevance of pineal dysfunction in ASD\nmediated by inflammation [153]. Several other studies have shown\nthat the pinealocytes express immunological receptors that may\nrecognize pathogens and other cytokines, as well as the cytokine\nTNF [68, 163, 169, 170]. Thus, it is plausible to hypothesize that\nneurodevelopment in ASD subjects may be a result of intra-uterine\nmilieu, genetic polymorphisms driven by circadian clock genes, or\ngenes involved in neuroendocrine responses, but also the activation\nof the immune-pineal axis, which remains off genetic changes and\nis a consequence of increased inflammation.\nOne of the premises of the activation of the immune pineal axis\nrelies on its ability to induce the so-called, \u2018extra-pineal\u2019 synthesis\nof melatonin outside the pineal gland. It is a matter of mention that\nthis extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin does not follow the circadian\norchestration, and thus, it is not thought to be a response\nderived from the SCN. On the other hand, melatonin synthesized\nrhythmically at the retina, but not under control of the SCN, relies\nas a major source for allowing retinal cell arrangement and preventing\nlight-induced retinal damage [171,172]. On the other hand,\nextra-pineal synthesis of melatonin, besides a beneficial signal,\nmaybe indicates chronodisruption, but still, prevent tissue damage.\nOnce synthesized, the pineal-derived melatonin is immediately\nreleased into the systemic circulation to reach peripheral and central\ntarget tissues. At this level, the melatonin distributes a nocturnal/\ncircadian message within the entire body to regulate daily and\nphysiological rhythms through different molecular pathways. On\nthe other hand, extra-pineal synthesis of melatonin orchestrates\nnon-rhythmic aspects of cellular defense in the cell of production,\nwhich may include an increase in phagocytosis and cell survival\n[64]. Independently on the local of its synthesis, the most wellcharacterized\npathway for melatonin transduction is the binding and\nactivation of the membrane specific G protein-coupled melatonin\nreceptors MT1 and MT2 [173]. Both receptors were found to present\nday/night differences in expression in the SCN of rats and primates,\nas well in other hypothalamic areas involved in the regulation\nof biological rhythms [174]. The identification of mutations in\nthe genes encoding melatonin receptors was already demonstrated\nin ASD [175] as well as the positive effects on sleep and behavior\nafter the administration of the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon\n[176].\nConsidering that the rise of the endogenous melatonin concentration\nis often used as a marker of a particular phase of the circadian\nrhythm (i.e. nighttime), reduction in nocturnal melatonin\npeak leads to a dysregulation of the temporal machinery, which\nmay be expressed by deficient sleep consolidation and difficulty in\ninitiating or maintaining sleep. Melatonin also affects the synchronicity\nof clock gene expression (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, Rev-erb\u03b1,\nClock, and Cry1) in both central and peripheral target tissues [177].\nIn addition, pinealectomy, in animal models, abolishes the rhythmic\nexpression of Per1 in the pars tuberalis [178] and results in desynchronized\nPer1 and Per2 expressions in the SCN [179].\nAgomelatine, a melatonin agonist, was effective and well-tolerated\nfor treating insomnia and regulate circadian rhythms of sleep and\ntemperature in ASD [180]. Taken together, these studies underlined\nthe major role of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin in the\nregulation of rhythms including the sleep-wake, and body temperature\ncycles, and more specifically for the synchronization of peripheral\noscillators (i.e., in the adjustment of the timing of existing oscillations).\nIn addition to its role as an internal sleep facilitator [177], melatonin\nacts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective\nagent [89, 100, 181]. Several lines of evidence suggest that melatonin\ncould also modulate neuronal networks in several brain areas.\nBesides the SCN [182], melatonin was shown to act in the hippocampus,\nfirst modulating memory consolidation by phosphorylation\nof CREB (CRE-binding protein) modulation through a mechanism\ninvolving MT1 receptor [182, 183]. Second, melatonin significantly\ninhibits synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) in\nthe hippocampus through a mechanism involving MT2-receptor\n[184]. Indeed, melatonin seems to modulate day/night variations in\nglutamate and GABA systems, known to be involved in ASD [185].\nAltogether, several lines of evidence highlight that melatonin may\nact in different receptors for controlling functional responses, which\nopens perspectives for the use of selective melatonergic-system\nbased drugs.", "metadata": {"name": "Dysregulation of Circadian Rhythms in Autism Spectrum Disorders", "page": 6, "pdf_id": "4a98b445-1f09-4a39-8425-dd23b7140e64"}, "id": "16"}, {"document": "into perspective, there are \u22482 \u00d7 106 phospholipid molecules\nin 1 \u03bcm2 area of lipid bilayer.[28,29] Therefore, \u22485 molecules of\nMJH will be inserted in the lipid bilayer for every 100 lipid\nmolecules.\nThe NIR 730 nm photon carries E = hc/\ud835\udf06 = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221219 J energy,\nwhere h is Planck\u2019s constant, and c is the speed of light.

Additional Photothermal and Photochemical Considerations\nPreviously, we have distinguished the MJH-mediated mechanical\naction through VDA from photothermal effects and photochemical\nreactions and the major findings are discussed in\nthe introduction.[23] It is important to realize that the absorption\nof 730 nm light by MJH is nearly the same for the group\nof cyanines in this study when compared at the equal concentration\n(2.7 \u03bcM) as shown in Figures S14,S15 (Supporting Information).\nA photothermal mechanism could not explain the membrane\nopening activity since the photothermal effects are directly\nproportional to the light absorption cross-section (molar extinction)\nand the concentration of the molecules or light-absorbing\nnanoparticles.[24] Indeed, the light absorption intensity in water\nof the most VDA activemolecule (BL-204) is among the lowest in\nthe group. Furthermore, lower concentrations were sufficient for\nthe most active MJH (VDA IC50 = 0.12 \u03bcM) to open cell membranes\nwhere the photothermal regime is negligible, thus further\nsupporting the mechanical mechanism of action rather than\nphotothermal.\nRegarding the photochemical reactions, here we further explore\nthat a high-concentration mixture of ROS scavengers\n(100mMTU and 2.5mMsodium azide)[23] cannot stop the MJHmediated\ncellmembrane permeabilization (Figure S22, Supporting\nInformation). Four MJH were evaluated (BL-204, GL-308-2,\nBL-141-2 and BL-142) in two independent experiments (n = 2).\nThe results further suggest that the photochemical reactions are\nless likely responsible for the rapid permeabilization of cellmembranes\nwithin 10 min or less. Instead, others have shown that\nthe photochemical reactions by cyanines caused slow apoptotic\ncell death through oxidative stress.[25] Overall, the evidence continues\nto support that MJH-mediated cell membrane opening\nthrough VDA is likely different than photothermal and photochemical\nmechanisms.\n2.5. Guidelines to Design and Synthesize Plasmon-Driven MJH\nHaving identified quantitative parameters, the EPI, and VDA activity,\nwe outline the guidelines to build more active plasmondriven\nMJH. 1) The C6-ring in the polymethine bridge increases\nthe plasmonicity and VDA activity to permeabilize cells (Figure\nS17, Supporting Information). This effect is presumably due to\nthe C6-ring increasing the rigidity of the polymethine bridge,\nallowing better conjugation and thereby oscillation of the electron\ndensity along the longitudinal axis of the molecule. 2) The\nlength of the polymethine bridge influences the plasmonicity and\nthereby the vibronic effect to permeabilize cells (Figure S18, Supporting\nInformation). The longer the \ud835\udf0b-conjugation, the higher\nthe plasmonicity index. This is consistent with theoretical calculations\nthat predict that the plasmonicity index should be directly\nproportional to the number of atoms in polyaromatic hydrocarbon\nsystems.[33] 3) The addition of a fused benzene ring to the\nindole increases the plasmonicity and thereby the VDA activity\nbecause it increases the \ud835\udf0b-conjugation and the number of atoms\nthat can support the plasmon oscillation (Figure S19, Supporting\nInformation). In contrast, the lack of fused benzenemoieties\nsuch as in Cy7-amine and Cy5-amine limits the molecular plasmon\noscillation of the electron density in the transverse direction.\nThe weak TMP resonance is observed in the UV\u2013vis spectrum\nof Cy7-amine at \u2248380 nm in Figure S14 (Supporting Information)\nand Cy5-amine at \u2248320 nm in Figure S15 (Supporting\nInformation). 4) Substitution of the indole by other alternative\nresonance structures, such as 1-methylquinoline, weakens\nthe plasmonicity and the VDA activity (Figure S20, Supporting\nInformation). Like point 3, the 1-methylquinoline limits the oscillation\nof the electron density along the transverse axis of the\nmolecule as shown by the weak TMP in the UV\u2013vis spectrum of\nBL-206 at \u2248370 nm in Figure S15 (Supporting Information). The\nposition of the maximum absorption wavelength for the peak,\na dipolar LMP mode, and the shoulder, a quadrupolar vibronic\nmode, split when measured in water as shown by the spectrum\nof BL-206 in Figure S15 (Supporting Information). This suggests\nthat the indole promotes a strong coupling of longitudinal and\ntransversal electron density oscillation in cyanine-based molecular\nplasmons while the 1-methylquinoline hinders the coupling.\n5) The addition of electron-withdrawing substituents such as N,\nN-dimethylamine within two carbon atoms of the nitrogen of the\nbenzoindole strongly improves the plasmonicity and VDA activity.\nThe compounds with this structural element, BL-204 and GL-\n308-2 (Figure 2), are the top performers in the library of compounds.\nThe N, N-dimethylamine might be producing a charge\nperturbation that induces charge transfer in the system, leading\nto the formation of stronger coupling between the longitudinal\ndipolar and quadrupolar molecular plasmon modes (Figure S14,\nSupporting Information), analogous to the effect in plasmonic\ngold nanoparticles that can be perturbed by a small gold sphere\nattached to the nanoparticle.[34] This effect is observed in BL-204\nand GL-308-2, Figure S14 (Supporting Information) when the\nabsorption peak of the dipolar LMP diminished significantly in\nwater and partially merged with the shoulder into a single peak.\nThis occurs because the energy level of the dipolar LMP and the\nquadrupolar vibronic mode, the shoulder in the spectrum, approaches\ndegeneracy by the perturbation of the protonated N, Ndimethylamine\nin water.", "metadata": {"name": "How to Build Plasmon-Driven Molecular Jackhammers that Disassemble Cell Membranes and Cytoskeletons in Cancer", "page": 7, "pdf_id": "10c5984f-d755-4b18-be0b-84d66e2cdd8a"}, "id": "25"}, {"document": "disulfide form of glutathione are altered in blood as well\nas urine in ASD (Bjorklund et al. 2020b; Osredkar et al.\n2019).

Increased mitochondrial dysfunction\nand damage tomitochondrial DNA are evident in ASD\npatients (Griffiths and Levy 2017; Napoli et al. 2013; Rossignol\nand Frye 2014). Disruption of electron transport\nchain (ETC) leading to ROS generation has been observed\nin patients with ASD (Chauhan et al. 2011). Interestingly,\nall these processes seem to be controlled in part or in full\nby circadian rhythms. Although a few data directly link\ncircadian disruption with altered oxidative stress\npathway in ASD, a study has demonstrated regulatory role\nof core circadian proteins in neuronal redox homeostasis\nand linked impaired function of the clock genes to neurodegeneration\n(Musiek et al. 2013). Based on these data, a\ndisrupted circadian rhythm is likely to be involved in\ndriving ASD pathogenesis, at least in part through\ninduction of oxidative stress pathway.\nCircadian rhythm, metabolic abnormalities,\nand risk of ASD\nCircadian rhythms strongly influence metabolic processes\nand show a bidirectional cross-talk with almost all metabolic\nprocesses, such as carbohydrate, lipid, protein, and\namino acidmetabolism(Serin and Acar Tek 2019). Circadian\nrhythms regulate the overall metabolic homeostasis by\ninteracting with metabolic processes both at the neuroendocrine\nand neuroanatomic levels. Chronic disruption of\ncircadian rhythm leads to significant changes in metabolism\nand subsequently to neuronal plasticity and\nbehavior (Karatsoreos et al. 2011). In this section, we highlight\nthe functional interactions between circadian and\nmetabolic pathways and their possible implications in ASD\npathobiology.\nCircadian rhythms are involved in the metabolism of\nglutathione and many other metabolites. Dramatic oscillations\nin glucose, lipid, protein, and amino acid metabolism\noccur at different times of the day. Methionine, a\nvital amino acid shows circadian variation. It is also\nessential for the conversion of serotonin to melatonin in the\ndark and is catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase (NAT). During\nthe dark hours, norepinephrine release is upregulated from\nthe nerve endings of the superior cervical ganglion. This\nresults in increased levels of cAMP in pinealocytes that\nproduce more melatonin. The rhythmic expression and\nactivation of metabolic pathways take place in coordination\nwith clock genes, such as BMAL1, PER2, PER3, CRY1,\nand CRY2 (Sahar and Sassone-Corsi 2012b). Interestingly,\nrhythmicity of homocysteine levels has also been demonstrated\nto be dependent on CLOCK (Paul et al. 2014).\nPossible mechanisms\nCompelling evidence suggests important implications of\nmetabolic abnormalities in ASD pathobiology (Cheng et al.\n2017; Frye et al. 2013). Elements like homocysteine, glutathione,\ntryptophan, cysteine, creatinine, and neurotransmitters\nsuch as serotonin, melatonin, and norepinephrine\nare altered in ASD (Delaye et al. 2018; Rose et al. 2012;\nWang et al. 2016). Dysregulated circadian rhythm is likely\nto alter metabolism in brain and contribute to ASD.\nAlthough a direct causal link has not yet been established\nby empirical studies, one of the possible mechanisms\nthrough which circadian-metabolic axis might drive\nneurobiological basis of ASD is by modulating the tryptophan\ncatabolite (TRYCAT) pathway.\nTryptophan metabolism follows a circadian pattern\n(Rapoport and Beisel 1968). Tryptophan catabolism\nthrough kynurenine pathway is crucially involved in\ninflammation. An aberrant TRYCAT pathway has been\nlinked to ASD by several studies (Boccuto et al. 2013;\nKaluzna-Czaplinska et al. 2017). Alterations in the circadian\nrhythms due to tryptophan metabolism or vice versa\nand their modulatory effects on inflammation might\ninfluence ASD pathobiology.\nCircadian rhythm, disrupted\nneurotransmission, and ASD risk\nCircadian rhythms regulate the release and function of\nmultiple neurochemicals. Equally, various neurotransmitters\nalso modulate circadian rhythms. The expression of\nneurotransmitter-related genes in different brain regions\nalso follows circadian patterns (Weber et al. 2004).

In wild-type mice under nighttimerestricted\nfeeding of regular chow, total caloric intake is unaffected, but hepatic\ntriglyceride content decreases by 50% [85].\nDaily rhythm of feeding-fasting alone can drive rhythmic expression of hepatic\nmRNAs and metabolites in mice. Feeding rhythms could phase-entrain the accumulation\nof over 600 mRNAs and several metabolites in the liver of oscillatordeficient\nCry1/Cry2 double-knockout mice [22]. These results indicate the powerful\ninfluence of feeding timing on circadian regulation of metabolism [86, 87]. The\nimposed daily eating-fasting rhythm may counteract some of the adverse metabolic\neffects of genetically perturbed circadian clock. In a Per1 phosphorylation mutant\nmouse, increased daytime eating predisposes to weight gain. However, this genetic\npredisposition to weight gain can be countered without reducing caloric intake by\nimposing a daily rhythm of feeding-fasting [88]. These results are highlighting that\nthe circadian regulation of metabolic homeostasis is a synergistic product of direct\ncell-autonomous regulation and indirect feeding-fasting regulated processes.\nMoreover, few human studies have indicated managing the daily pattern of\neating-fasting might be a new approach to controlling obesity and metabolic\ndisease. In a weight loss study in Spain, subjects who ate earlier lunch showed\nhigher weight loss than those who ate later \u2013 even when both groups were controlled\nfor total caloric intake and physical activity [89].

This raises the possibility that daily pattern of feedingfasting\neven under the modern lifestyle of extended illumination can provide\nprotection against several chronic diseases.\n21.6 Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe importance of circadian timing has been demonstrated both through evolutionary\nrelevance and observed health implications of disrupted clock systems. While\nthe pathways that lie in the clock-metabolism interface are extensive and require\nfurther elucidation, molecular connections between the two are well established and\nprovide an important gateway by which circadian disruption contributes to metabolic\nsyndrome and related pathologies.\nPromising studies have shown alteration in circadian rhythm to have therapeutic\neffects. The timing of feeding and fasting, irrespective of total caloric intake, can\nreduce weight gain and improve metabolic parameters. It has been shown that time-\nrestricted feeding can have long-term effects against preexisting obesity even when\napplied only 5 days per week [86].

However, the nocturnal activation of PKA and\nphosphorylation of AANAT start the conversion of 5-HT into the\npenultimate indoleamine in melatonin formation, N-acetylserotonin\n(NAS), which is methylated by the enzyme acetylserotonin Omethyltransferase\n(ASMT) to produce melatonin (N-acetyl-5-\nmethoxytryptamine). Melatonin signals darkness in both diurnal\nand nocturnal animals. In rats, nocturnal Aanat expression as well\nas its protein activity, increase 100-150 times compared to daytime\nlevels [66, 83]. In humans, ungulates, and rodents that display diurnal\nactivity, this enzyme shows minor changes in gene expression\nbut has increased nocturnal activity due to \u03b21-adrenoceptor-induced\nPKA activation [84].\nMelatonin is a highly amphiphilic molecule that acts in Gcoupled\nprotein receptors and subcellular compartments and is released\nat night into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), via the pineal\nrecess, and bloodstream. Melatonin control over several target tissues\nultimately adjusts their biological rhythms [85, 86, 87]. Besides,\nmelatonin also regulates several cellular activities, including\nreduction of oxidative stress [88, 89], modulation of Ca2+-\ncalmodulin interaction [90], and inhibition of transcription factors,\nsuch as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) [91].\nMelatonin, the pineal hormone, is also synthesized in extrapineal\nsites [92], such as the retina [93], gastrointestinal tract [94],\nskin [95], immune cells [96-98], and other areas of the brain\n[99,100]. The synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent cells is\npositively mediated by NF-\u03baB [64]. The dual effect of NF-\u03baB in\npinealocytes and monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells is\ndependent on the NF-\u03baB dimer that is translocated to the nucleus.\nThus, melatonin is not only the hormone of darkness but also a\nmediator of defense responses. The classical hormonal effect depends\non the daily rhythm mediated by pinealocyte synthesis,\nwhich is controlled by the SCN, and, therefore, the environmental\nlighting, whereas, the synthesis of melatonin by immune-competent\ncells relies on the activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway [64].\nThe importance of inflammation in disturbances of brain\nfunction, including ASD gains remarkable relevance, as chronic\nlower-grade inflammation is underneath many neurological disturbances,\nincluding ASD [101]. Descriptions of anti-inflammatory\neffects of melatonin due to the ability of the molecule to donate\nelectrons or to reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators, or induction\nof the anti-inflammatory hormones and cytokines are welldescribed\nin the literature [64, 97, 102]. The melatonin\nanti-\u00ad\u2010inflammatory effects include downregulation of cyclooxygenase-\u00ad\u2010\n2 and proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of toll-\u00ad\u2010like\nreceptor-\u00ad\u20104 and NF-\u03baB activation, upregulation of anti-\u00ad\u2010inflammatory\ncytokines and antioxidant effects [64, 102-104]. Melatonin also\nimpairs the migration of leukocytes from the blood to tissue, restraining\nthe arrival of neutrophils [105], Despite most of the studies,\nanti-inflammatory effects, in some situations melatonin lead to\npro-inflammatory responses. This dual effect might be obtained in\nthe same cell model, depending on the basal state of the cells. In\ncultured rat cerebellar cells, the effect of melatonin varies according\nto a previous activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. In the non-activated\nstate, melatonin leads to cell death, while in the presence of a proinflammatory\nstimulus, there is a protection of the cells. Melatonin\nmay determine the activation of inhibition of inducible nitric oxide\nsynthase [106]. In summary, melatonin modulates the immunological\nresponses in healthy and pathogenic states [64, 97, 102, 103,\n107-109].\nA question that is still open refers to the putative physiological\nrole of melatonin synthesized by the immune-competent cells.\nOverall, it is considered that the effects of extra-pineal synthesis of\nmelatonin, remarkably not related to the orchestration of body\nrhythms, may also be protective of the regular function of the\nphysiological areas of the brain. Indeed, we have a major contribution\nto the understanding that inflammatory signals, which block\nthe circadian translation of melatonin production of melatonin in\nthe pineal gland, may also protect brain areas to lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS)-induced neuroinflammation [100]. Importantly, in the experimental\ndesign, the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum glial\ncells showed an increase in the AANAT expression, the penultimate\nenzyme for melatonin synthesis. This data suggests that in\ncertain circumstances, melatonin, or even its precursor, NAS, may\nprotect the brain for neuronal death or injury occurring along with\npre-natal or postnatal neurodevelopment, or along with brain maturation.\nIndeed, NAS has been proposed to act on the BDNF system\nfor regulating hippocampal neuronal network and preventing neuronal\ndeath and improving neuroanatomical connections, thus preventing\nloss-of-function [110].\n4. SLEEP IN ASD\nHumans usually spend about one-third of their lives sleeping.\nAlthough the function and implications of this process are not fully\nunderstood, it is clear that sleep problems induce several changes in\nthe body. Sleep is paramount for the proper healthy brain development\nand functioning of neurocognitive functions, such as attention,\nmemory consolidation and reasoning with a direct influence on\nlearning, behavior, mood [20, 111-115]. Therefore, in general\nhealth, sleep is needed for the restoration of body homeostasis and\ninfluences metabolism and the immune system [116]. It is also\nknown that prolonged sleep deprivation can represent severe physical\nand behavioral impairments [117, 118]. Therefore, it is relevant\nto highlight that misalignment of sleep may have additional consequences\nto several outcomes observed in ASD subjects [119].\nSleep is a complex state that presents characteristic brain electrical\nactivity in different phases [120]. A stage of non-rapid eye\nmovement phase (NREM) sleep called slow-wave sleep (SWS) is\ncharacterized by the presence of slow brain waves interspersed with\nsmaller and faster waves. By the achievement in the early hours of\nsleep, SWS phase is concomitant with a state of relaxation and\ndecreased tone in the peripheral muscle, reduced respiration, heart\nrate, and blood pressure. The individual length of SWS seems to be\ndirectly related to the need for sleep previous accumulated, which\nreinforces how important is the need for having a regular sleep\npattern. After following deed into sleep, brain waves continue in a\nsynchronized pattern until rapid eye movement (REM) sleep begins,\nwhich brain electrical activity and breathing become faster, it\nmay occur an increase in heart rate, while paradoxically, blood\npressure decreases and muscle tone practically disappear [121].\nREM sleep plays an important role in memory consolidation, learning,\nas well as mood regulation [112, 113]. These phenomena reinforce\nthe high relevance of sleep in orchestrating mood changes in\nASD. Preventing sleep disturbances seems to ameliorate several\naspects of behavior. Therefore, the clinical use of subjective measures\nof sleep, such as parent-report questionnaires and sleep diaries,\nare validated instruments for diagnosing ASD [122].\nPhysiologically, two mechanisms are responsible for sleepwake\npatterns: the sleep-wake-dependent homeostatic processes\nand the circadian rhythms. Homeostatic pressure to initiate and\nmaintain sleep may gradually build-up accordingly wakefulness\n[123, 124]. In addition to the homeostatic issue, determination of\nthe sleep/wake cycle periodicity is characterized by the circadian\ntiming system, even in the absence of environmental cues [124].\nThe harmony between homeostatic processes and circadian timing\nsystem form the typical pattern of sleep and wakefulness in adults\nunder normal conditions, consisting of approximately 16 hours of\nconstant wakefulness during the day and 8 hours of consolidated\nsleep at night, although sleep needs may change along with the\ncourse of life [123, 124]. In humans, multiple sleep/wake cycles are\nobserved during the day and nighttime until the fourth month of\nage, then, daytime sleep progressively decreases, and by five years\nof age, the biphasic sleep/wake cycle is fully established [125, 126].\nThe normal sleep/wake rhythms seem to be crucial for appropriate\ncognitive development in children.

These alterations appear early in the\ndisease, before hallmarks such as memory impairment, amyloid-b\n(Ab) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (Musiek et al., 2015). AD\ncircadian symptoms include sleep disruptions and a greater severity\nof behavioral symptoms later in the day, known as sundowning.\nCircadian disruptions are also observed at the molecular level, with\nalterations in circadian clock gene expression in the brains of AD\npatients (Cermakian et al., 2011). These circadian alterations are\nparticularly interesting because they may play a role in disease\nprogression: sleep can facilitate Ab clearance from the brain (Xie\net al., 2013; Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018) and poor sleep quality\nin adulthood is a risk factor for AD later in life (Sabia et al.,\n2021). Additionally, sleep disruptions caused by altered circadian\nrhythms significantly increase the difficulty of caring for AD\npatients (Kang et al., 2009; Musiek et al., 2015). Thus understanding\nthe mechanisms of circadian disruption in AD could have both\nimportant preventative and therapeutic potential.\nMany circadian phenotypes seen in humans with AD are\nrecapitulated in mouse models of AD. Certain AD models\ndemonstrate changes to the free running period (the intrinsic\nperiod of an animal\u2019s circadian behavior when kept in constant\ndarkness) and activity in light or dark phases (Sheehan and Musiek,\n2020). AD model mice also score better in anxiety tests earlier in\ntheir active period compared to later (Bedrosian et al., 2011), a\nphenotype reminiscent of sundowning in AD patients. Circadian\nalterations are recapitulated at the molecular level as well, with\nchanges to the amplitude and phase of rhythmic clock gene\nexpression in some AD models including 3xTg (Bellanti et al., 2017)\nand 5xFAD (Song et al., 2015) mice.\nOther facets of circadian rhythms have been less well-studied\nin AD models. Entrainment is the process of synchronizing\nthe biological circadian clock with the daily rhythm of the\nenvironment. In this study we tested circadian behavior in models\nof AD using a \u201cjet lag\u201d protocol. We found that female 3xTg\nmice re-entrain more rapidly than wild type (WT) controls.\nWe then examined neuroinflammation, amyloid pathology, and\nchanges to light sensing as possible contributors to this altered\ncircadian behavior.\nResults\n3xTg mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\nTo test the re-entrainment behavior of AD model mice, we\nfirst studied female 3xTg mice. The 3xTg mouse model of AD\ncarries pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP),\npresenilin 1 (PS1), and human tau (MAPT), resulting in progressive\naccumulation in the brain of Ab plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\nSex-specific circadian behavioral alterations have previously been\nobserved in 3xTg mice (Sterniczuk et al., 2010), and female 3xTg\nmice have a more rapid progression of AD pathology than males\n(Dennison et al., 2021). In a photic phase shift experiment, which\nmeasures the shifting of circadian behavior caused by one pulse\nof light during the dark phase, female 3xTg mice showed a trend\ntoward greater phase shifting while males did not (Sterniczuk et al.,\n2010). We examined re-entrainment in these mice using a shifted\nlight-dark (LD) cycle, simulating travel across 6 time zones and\nsubsequent \u201cjet lag.\u201d This behavior is not altered in male 3xTg\nmice (Gonz\u00e1lez-Luna et al., 2021), but female mice, which have\nmore severe AD pathology than males, have not been studied in\nthis paradigm. We allowed female 8-month-old (mo) 3xTg and\nB6129SF2/J wild type (WT) control mice to entrain to a 12:12 L:D\nlight cycle and monitored their behavior on a running wheel. At\nthis age, female 3xTg mice have only mild Ab and tau pathology\n(Figure 1A). Plaques and phosphorylated tau are not observed in\nthe SCN (Supplementary Figure 1A). After full entrainment and\nhabituation to the running wheel, the LD cycle was advanced by\n6 h (Figure 1B). The onset of nightly running was measured in\nthe days following the light cycle shift. 3xTg activity onset was\nsignificantly earlier than WT following the light cycle shift on\nday 2 after the shift (Figure 1C), demonstrating more rapid reentrainment.\nWe calculated the number of days each mouse took\nto complete half of the re-entrainment, the 50% phase shift (PS50),\nand found that mean PS50 was 1.07 days earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice (p < 0.006) (Figure 1D). We examined free-running period\nwhen kept in 24 h darkness (Figure 1E) and preference for running\nduring the dark phase (Figure 1F) and found no difference between\n3xTg and WT in these other aspects of circadian behavior. Total\nrunning was not affected by genotype (Figure 1G), suggesting that\nthe wheel running re-entrainment phenotype is not influenced by\nthe hyperactivity or perseverative behavior sometimes observed in\nAD mouse models.\nTo test this phenotype as AD pathology progresses with aging,\nwe repeated this experiment using 13 mo female 3xTg and WT\nmice, which have more advanced amyloid and tau pathology\n(Figures 1H, I), though they still lack plaques and phosphorylated\ntau in the SCN (Supplementary Figure 1B). Behavior onset after\nthe light cycle shift was significantly earlier in 13-month 3xTg than\nWT mice on days 1\u20134 after the shift (Figure 1J). Mean PS50 at\n13 months was 1.41 days faster (p < 0.001) in 3xTg than WT\n(Figure 1K). Free running period and preference for running in the\ndark phase were not affected by genotype (Figures 1L, M). Total\nrunning was again not affected by genotype (Figure 1N). These\nresults show that 3xTg mice re-entrain more rapidly in a jet lag\nparadigm at multiple stages of pathological progression.\n3xTg mice exhibit a metabolic phenotype resulting in greater\nbody weight than B6129SF2/J controls (Robison et al., 2020), and\nlost more weight during their time with running wheel access,\nbut neither greater body weight nor greater weight loss correlated\nwith more rapid re-entrainment (Supplementary Figures 2A\u2013F).\nThese metabolic differences are thus not likely to contribute to the\nobserved re-entrainment phenotype.\nMicroglia depletion does not alter\ncircadian re-entrainment in 3xTg mice\nAs neuronal loss does not appear in AD until long after the\ndevelopment of circadian symptoms, we sought other possible\nmechanisms underlying this behavioral phenotype.

Many research\ngroups have reported that inadequate artificial lighting interferes with melatonin\nproduction and disrupts the circadian rhythm. This study considered biological functions\nfor light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of next-generation illumination, and LED packages and\nspectra suitable for both daytime and nighttime applications were designed. The prepared\ndaytime human-centric (HC)-LEDs had a melanopic/photopic (M/P) ratio that was up to\n26% higher than that of conventional (c)-LEDs, whereas the nighttime HC-LEDs\nexhibited up to a 26% lower M/P ratio compared to the c-LEDs. Nevertheless, because the\nHC-LED is designed to have almost the same color coordinates as the c-LED having the\nsame correlated-color temperature (CCT), there is no change in the perceived color. To\nsubstantiate the biological effect, melatonin level data were obtained from 22 voluntary\nparticipants in c- and HC-LED lighting environments. In the HC-LED lighting environment, melatonin was suppressed by 21.9%\nafter waking, and nocturnal melatonin secretion was increased by up to 12.2%. As human-centric lighting, our HC-LEDs are\nexpected to become an essential element for modern life, where people spend most of their time indoors.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nLight can visually and nonvisually affect humans through the\neyes\u2019 retinal cells. The secretion of hormones such as\nmelatonin and the resulting circadian rhythm can be\nphysiologically altered by the nonvisual effects of light.1\u22123\nUntil the discovery of retinal melanopsin in intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) of mammals4,5\nand humans,6,7 only the effect of light on the cones and rods of\nthe retina cell photoreceptors on providing as visual\ninformation was known. As photoreceptors, ipRGCs are\nparticularly sensitive to the absorption of blue light with a\nwavelength of 480 nm. There is evidence that radiation within\nthe 460 to 500 nm wavelength can regulate the circadian\nrhythm for a natural day to night cycle.8 In this context, bright\nlight with a wavelength of 460 to 500 nm during the evening\nand night in terms of its effects on melatonin levels is\nconsidered unsuitable for proper relaxation and sleep.\nDisruption of a traditional nighttime circadian rhythm can be\nexplained by exposure to the wrong kind of light at an\ninappropriate time.9,10 Because the human biological clock is\npromptly synchronized with the natural light\u2212dark cycle, it is\ncritical for people in today\u2019s modern world to use or be\nexposed to light properly. The biological clock is influenced by\nexposure to light and affects hormones, (core) body temperature,\nand sleep.11\u221215\nOver the last two decades, solid-state lighting (SSL)-based\nphosphor-converted lighting-emitting diodes (pc-LEDs) have\nevolved extensively because of their potential and/or practical\napplications in backlight units for liquid crystal displays\n(LCDs), traffic lights, and general illumination, including\nindoor and outdoor lamps. LEDs have been adopted on the\nbasis of satisfactory performance such as low power\nconsumption, high brightness, small size, fast response time,\nand long lifetime.16,17 To date, most LED lighting development\nhas been focused on energy performance and color\nqualities of white LEDs such as high luminous efficacy (LE),\nhigh color rendering index (CRI), and low power consumption.\n18,19 However, these optical and energy-saving\nproperties fail to represent the full performance potential of", "metadata": {"name": "Development and Verification of a 480 nm Blue Light Enhanced/ Reduced Human-Centric LED for Light-Induced Melatonin Concentration Control", "page": 1, "pdf_id": "7bf5e224-ab9c-4905-b0aa-1aa518d24fc1"}, "id": "60"}, {"document": "also supported a developmental role of circadian genes\n(Kobayashi et al. 2015). The circadian genes determine the\ncritical period timing of various neuronal processes like\nneuronal migration, neurogenesis as well as neuronal plasticity\nboth during prenatal and postnatal brain development.\nA recent mouse study suggests that early-life disruption of\ncircadian rhythm results in long-lasting changes in somatic\nand behavioral development (Smarr et al. 2017). Notably,\nthe programming of neurobiological changes relevant to\nASD pathophysiology also occurs during prenatal as well\nas postnatal brain development. Support towards a link\nbetween circadian induced neurodevelopmental abnormality\nand risk of ASD has also been derived from genetic\nstudies. Mutations/genetic variations within both the circadian\ngenes, PER3 and Nr1d1 involved in neurodevelopment\nwere reported in patients with ASD (Goto et al. 2017; Yang\net al. 2016).\nCircadian rhythm, immune dysregulation,\nand ASD risk\nClose interactions and reciprocal regulation of circadian\nrhythm and immune function exist. This is essential in\nmaintaining physiological homeostasis, neuronal function,\nand behavior (Cermakian et al. 2013). Disruption of\nthe cross-talk between circadian clock elements and the\nimmune components might have enduring effects on\nneuronal processes as well as behavior. This section will\nhighlight the bidirectional cross-talk between circadian\nrhythms and the immune system and the possible deleterious\nconsequences of altered regulation of these biological\nprocesses on the risk and progression of ASD.\nCells of the immune system have molecular clock\ncomponents. Clock genes are present within macrophages,\ndendritic cells, and B and T lymphocytes (Bollinger et al.\n2011; Silver et al. 2012). It is noteworthy that some circadian\nproteins are involved in the differentiation and lineage\ncommitment of T lymphocytes. For example, ROR\u03b3 or ROR\u03b1\nhave direct regulatory roles in the circadian expression of\nclock genes (Takeda et al. 2012). Mice deficient of ROR\u03b3 or\nROR\u03b1 have significantly reduced expression levels of CRY1,\nBMAL1, E4bp4, REV-ERB\u03b1, and PER2. Lack of ROR\u03b1 or\nRORc impairs development of Th17 cells (Yang et al. 2008).\nThese and other findings suggest a critical role of RORs in\nthe circadian rhythm, immunity, and metabolism (Jetten\n2009).\nCirculating immune cells, levels of cytokines and\nchemokines as well as expression of adhesion molecules\ninvolved in the migration of immune cells exhibit 24 h daily\noscillations (Labrecque and Cermakian 2015; Nakao 2014).\nHoming of lymphocytes to lymph nodes generally peaks at\nnight, and they exit the tissue during the day. This implies\ncircadian regulation of lymphocyte trafficking through\nlymph nodes (Druzd et al. 2017). There is a growing recognition\nthat diurnal variation of the immune response is also\npromoted by microglia, the resident immune cells in the\nbrain (Martinez-Tapia et al. 2020). Microglia too possesses a\ncircadian clock, and microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory\nresponses are controlled by this circadian\nclock (Fonken et al. 2015).\nCircadian rhythms also influence the efficiency of the\nimmune response, although the precise mechanistic basis\nis yet to be fully elucidated. This could be achieved through\nmolecular interactions between the regulators of circadian\nrhythm and the immune system. The mediators of the\ncircadian clock have a direct effect on transcriptional\nactivity of the immune components, driving the expression\nor repression of immune genes (Hergenhan et al. 2020).\nPossible mechanisms\nAberrant immune responses, inflammation, and autoimmunity\nare linked to ASD (Meltzer and Van de Water 2017).\nAmong the immunological abnormalities in ASD, systemic\ninflammation indexed by elevated levels of inflammatory\ncytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-17 as\nwell as a disrupted T cell network and neuroinflammation\nare common (Ashwood et al. 2011; Masi et al. 2015). Chronic\ndisruption of the circadian rhythm contributes to inflammatory\nresponses (Castanon-Cervantes et al. 2010). In mice,\nlong-term circadian misalignment accelerates immune\nsenescence as well as chronic inflammation (Inokawa et al.\n2020). It is envisaged that immune abnormalities and/or\ninflammation in ASD could be the result of circadian dysregulation.\nThough empirical support for this notion is\ncurrently not available, indirect evidences explicated below\ndoes not rule out such a possibility.\ni) Th17 cells are increasingly being implicated in the\nimmune-inflammatory responses. Higher number of\nactivated Th17 cells are reported in children with ASD\n(Basheer et al. 2018). Another study examining Th17/\nTreg cells imbalance observed a significantly skewed\nresponse towards Th17 in children with ASD (Moaaz\net al. 2019). Reduced expression of ROR\u03b1, a master\nregulator of Th17 cells was reported in brains of\nindividuals with ASD and this was influenced by\nepigenetic alterations in the RORA gene (Nguyen\net al. 2010). ROR\u03b1 is directly involved in the regulation\nof circadian expression of clock genes.

PLX treatment effectively depleted microglia\nfrom the brain in WT and 3xTg mice, reducing the number of\nmicroglia in the ventromedial hypothalamus, the region containing\nthe SCN, by > 98% (Figures 2C, D). After 7 days of PLX or control\ntreatment, light cycles were advanced by 6 h and running wheel\nbehavior monitored (Figure 2E). PLX treatment did not rescue\nthe more rapid re-entrainment in 3xTg mice, and there was no\nsignificant effect of treatment on time of running onset (Figure 2F).\nAs in Figure 1, behavior onsets were earlier in 3xTg than WT\nmice, with a significant effect of genotype on time of running onset\n(p < 0.001). PLX treatment did not significantly alter PS50 in 3xTg\nmice (Figure 2G). There was a non-significant trend toward higher\nPS50 in WT control vs. PLX-treated mice (p < 0.415). There was\nno significant effect of treatment on PS50 (p < 0.316), but the effect\nof genotype on PS50 was again significant (p < 0.001). Thus, acute\nmicroglia depletion did not rescue the re-entrainment phenotype\nobserved in 3xTg mice. PLX treatment also did not alter other\nrunning behaviors measured, with no significant effect of genotype\nor treatment found in percent running during the dark phase or\ntotal distance traveled (Figures 2H, I). These data demonstrate that\nre-entrainment remains altered in microglia-depleted 3xTg mice,\nsuggesting that microglia and neuroinflammation are not acutely\nresponsible for this circadian phenotype.\n5xFAD mice have accelerated circadian\nre-entrainment\n3xTg mice carry mutations driving pathological Ab and\ntau expression in the brain. To probe whether both of these\npathological proteins are necessary in order to produce the reentrainment\nphenotype we observed in 3xTg mice, we studied reentrainment\nin 5xFAD mice. The 5xFAD model expresses mutant\nAPP and PS1 transgenes, but no mutant tau transgene, and\nthus develops aggressive amyloid pathology without neurofibrillary\ntangles. 5xFAD mice show altered molecular circadian rhythms\nand circadian behavior (Song et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2020). Based\non the observed behavioral phenotype in 8 mo 3xTg mice, which\nhave amyloid pathology but little tauopathy, we hypothesized that\nAb is sufficient to alter re-entrainment. We studied female 5xFAD\nmice at 7 months of age, at which time they have extensive\nAb plaques (Figure 3A), though none are detected in the SCN\n(Supplementary Figure 1C). We repeated the jet lag experiment\ndescribed above in these aged 5xFAD mice (Figure 3B). Behavior\nonset was significantly earlier in 5xFAD mice than WT mice\non days 2\u20134 after the shift (Figure 3C), and mean PS50 was\nreached 2.27 days earlier (p < 0.006) (Figure 3D). Free-running\nperiod and preference for running during the dark phase were\nnot significantly affected by genotype (Figures 3E, F). Total\nrunning distance was not altered in 5xFAD mice, suggesting\nthat hyperactivity or perseverative behavior were not responsible\nfor altered performance on the running wheel in this model\n(Figure 3G). These results closely recapitulate the findings in aged\n3xTg mice. Thus, amyloid pathology in the absence of mutant tau\nis sufficient to alter circadian re-entrainment in these AD mouse\nmodels.\n5xFAD mice do not display the same increased bodyweight\nphenotype as 3xTg mice, and we again found no consistent\ncorrelation between body weight or weight loss during the running\nwheel period and speed of re-entrainment (Supplementary\nFigures 2G\u2013I).\nTo test whether abnormal tau can drive this re-entrainment\nphenotype in the absence of Ab pathology, we repeated the jet lag\nexperiment with the PS19 mouse model, which carries a mutation\ndriving aggressive tauopathy, but does not carry amyloidogenic\nmutations (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Unlike the 3xTg and 5xFAD\nmodels, re-entrainment was not altered in female PS19 mice at\n7 months (Supplementary Figure 3). The rapid re-entrainment\nof WT controls for this model may obscure fine differences\nbetween groups, but the absence of a trend toward more rapid\nre-entrainment in this tauopathy model further supports the\nhypothesis that the re-entrainment phenotype is driven by amyloid,\nrather than tau, pathology.\nAD model mice exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to photic cues\nLight entering via the retina entrains the SCN circadian clock.\nAmyloid and tau pathology are detectable in the retina in AD (Hart\net al., 2016; Koronyo et al., 2017), and the cells which provide photic\ninputs from the retina to the circadian system, the intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are decreased in\nAD (La Morgia et al., 2016). We next examined whether altered\nre-entrainment in 3xTg mice could be influenced by altered light\nsensing in the retina, rather than altered circadian timekeeping in\nthe SCN.\nThe jet lag re-entrainment paradigm relies on the retina to\ndetect photic entrainment cues and the SCN to shift the biological\nclock in response to those cues. We next tested negative masking, a\ntest of behavioral response to light that depends on the retina and is\npreserved in SCN-ablated animals (Redlin and Mrosovsky, 1999).\nMasking is a phenomenon wherein changes in light conditions can\nalter normally circadian-controlled behaviors without first altering\nthe circadian pacemaker. For example, a mouse running in the dark\nmay stop running if the lights are suddenly turned on, in spite of it\nstill being the animal\u2019s active phase. To measure negative masking,\nwe gave a 1-h pulse of light of different intensities beginning 1 h\nafter the onset of the dark phase of a 12:12 LD cycle and monitored\nrunning wheel activity of 8 mo 3xTg andWTmice during that time.\nBy comparing to running during uninterrupted darkness, we could\ncalculate the degree to which different intensities of light masked\nrunning behavior, and therefore measure the sensitivity of the\nmouse to circadian light cues in a non-SCN-dependent system. We\nfound a significant difference in negative masking behavior between\n3xTg and WT mice (p < 0.02), and 3xTg running was significantly\nmore suppressed by low-intensity 2.9 \u0002 1012 photons/cm2/s\nlighting than WT (p < 0.037) (Figure 4A). Unexpectedly, this\ndemonstrates an elevated responsiveness to photic circadian signals\nin AD model mice, raising the possibility that increased sensitivity\nto the photic re-entrainment cue in the jet lag paradigm may\ncontribute to more rapid re-entrainment.", "metadata": {"name": "Altered circadian behavior and light sensing in mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "page": 4, "pdf_id": "2adc961c-6913-45a2-bce5-5fd8aa504ffa"}, "id": "32"}, {"document": "disorders are among the most common medical complaints in society\nand have repercussions on cognitive performance [111], behavior\n[20], mood [127], adaptive capacity, and quality of life [113,\n128].\nThe most striking features of sleep disorders are usually: increased\nlatency, difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep, night\nwaking, and daytime sleepiness, which can result from sleep deprivation\nand interfere with productivity and quality of life [129].\nSleep problems are repeatedly observed in ASD (predominantly in\ninitiating and maintaining sleep. i.e sleep latency and nocturnal\nawakenings) [20, 130-132].\nASD children had frequently delayed development of the circadian\nsleep/wake cycle in the early years of life, thus, the identification\nof sleep disturbances could be useful in the identification of\nmarkers of vulnerability during infant\u2019s development for early ASD\nscreening and diagnosis since sleep problems co-occur with autistic\ntraits in early childhood [133, 134].\nThe symptoms are very heterogeneous, several studies revealed\nthat more than 70% of patients with ASD had delayed development\nof the expected pattern of circadian sleep/wake cycle for the age.\nThis problem is persistent since 40\u201393% of children with ASD\nshow a highly significant increase in sleep latency and nocturnal\nawakenings [130, 132, 135-137]. Our study in ASD individuals\naged from 4 to 18 years (mean 9.7 \u00b1 4.1 years old) showed that\n59% of the individuals with ASD had indicators of at least one type\nof sleep disorder. The sleep-breathing disorders were the most\nprevalent (38% of the subjects). Besides, disorders of initiating and\nmaintaining sleep were present in 24%, sleep-wake transition disorders\nwere present in 13%, and sleep hyperhidrosis was present in\n20% of the subjects [20]. Liu et al. [137] studied ASD children (age\n8.8 \u00b1 4.2) and showed that 86% had at least one sleep problem almost\nevery day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with\ninsomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep-disordered\nbreathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime\nsleepiness. Despite to be concordant on the major sleep problems\nfound in ASD, the available literature data show differences in the\ngravity and frequency of these problems probably because of differences\nin methodologies and population heterogeneity. Also,\nsleep architecture is abnormal in ASD including, in particular, the\nincreased proportion of stage 1 sleep, increased latency and decreased\nquantity in REM sleep, immature organization of REM, and\ndecreased total sleep time [23, 138].\nClock gene polymorphisms are known to be related to rhythmic\ndisturbances and circadian phenotypic alterations of sleep. The\nability of pathological conditions to alter clock gene expression in\nthe SCN and peripheral structures has already been described [41,\n49, 139]. Guissoni Campos et al. [41] showed that intracerebroventricular\ninflammation in rodents, induced by LPS, changed Per1 and\nPer2 expression in the SCN indicating that a neuroinflammatory\ncondition leads to desynchronization of primary and subordinate\nbrain oscillators, supporting the existence of the integration between\nthe immune and the circadian system. Inasmuch, a growing\nbody of evidence also postulates that glia cells are necessary for\nmaintaining a proper neuronal oscillation of the cells that drives\nbiological rhythms in the SCN [140], thus reinforcing the key role\nof inflammation in altering circadian rhythms. In a rodent model of\nsocial impairment, which assembles ASD features, and developed\nas a result of pre-natal exposition to inflammatory stimulation, we\nobserved worsening in the performance of strength, motor coordination,\nand spatial memory when compared to the controls, which\nwas associated with increased expression of IBA1 in the microglia\nof hippocampal areas [141].\nSome circadian genes have been associated with ASD including\nPER1, PER2, PER 3, CLOCK and ARNTL2 [56].

Thus, sleep problems in ASD are correlated with behavioral\nchanges, mood instability, and deficits in neurocognitive\nfunctions [20, 61, 119].\nChildren with ASD and poor sleep demonstrate significantly\nhigher daytime behavioral problems, including irritability, externalizing\nbehavior (specifically hyperactivity and aggression), and internalizing\nbehaviors (behaviors lashing out at the self, such as\nsocial withdrawal, anxiety depression), compared to those who\npresent a normal sleep pattern [21, 151]. Considering the possibilities\nof co-occurring conditions, many studies have indicated a potential\nlink between insufficient sleep and attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder (ADHD), one of the most common co-occurring\nconditions observed in ASD [152]. However, sleep problem severity\nin ASD is similar across ADHD and no- ADHD subgroups,\nwhich highlights that sleep disturbances in ASD is not influenced\nby co-occurring ADHD but favors the stereotyped behaviors\n[151,152].\nThe severity of sleep problems in ASD children becomes even\nclearer when parents of autistic children report changes in their\nsleep quality, which may be related to a result of their children's\nsleep problems [119]. The negative consequences of sleep disturbance\ncan, therefore, threaten the effectiveness of behavioral treatments\nas a result of reduced child performance and the reduced\nability of parents to correctly employ learned treatment techniques\nand strategies [22]. Thus, the early developmental and behavioral\nintervention is crucial for the management of ASD, and the success\nof such intervention hinges, at least partially, on the improvement\nin the sleep quality [30].\nTo investigate the rest-activity rhythm of ASD individuals, the\nactigraphy, which measures activity patterns via wristwatch-like\ndevices that contain miniature accelerometers, may be useful for\nmonitor along with several continuous days to accurately assess\nsleep patterns in children [26]. The most commonly reported behaviors\nacross studies evaluating the rhythm of sleep patterns in ASD\nsubjects by actigraphy are delayed sleep onset, waking up during\nthe night as well as early morning awakening [23, 26, 135] which\nlikely represent impairments in the generation of this circadian\nrhythm. Besides the sleep-wake cycle, the most widely used biomarker\nfor the study circadian dysregulation is the melatonin\nrhythm, the core-body temperature, and rest-activity measures. By\nusing these measures, together with other biomarkers, we were able\nto detect that ASD subjects present disruption of endocrine, immune\nand circadian responses, mostly related to the reduction of\nmelatonin production and increased inflammation [153].\n5.

INTRODUCTION\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder\ninvolving gene polymorphisms, intra-uterine and post-natal\nenvironment, autoimmune, and inflammatory factors. The diagnosis\nof ASD is based on behavioral changes, rather than its etiology, and\nmay be disclosed in non-dimorphic patients, as observed in the\nmajority of the cases, while sometimes may possess clinical manifestations\nas observed in some genetic syndromes [1, 2]. Neither\ngenetic factors nor the environmental components have been extensively\ncharacterized to allow a proper diagnosis and treatment of\nnon-syndromic ASD. Although its etiology is not fully understood,\nchanges in brain development impose maladaptation of several\nstructures and functions that are reflected in atypical behavioral\nalterations [3-5]. The prevalence of ASD, more common in boys\nrather than girls, has increased significantly throughout recent decades\n[6]. As a major structural problem, the brain alterations reveal\na continuum of behavioral features characterized by persistent\n*Address correspondence to this author at the Department of Speech, Language\nand Hearing Sciences, S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), 17525-\n900, Marilia, SP, Brazil; E-mail: luciana.pinato@unesp.br\nabnormal reciprocal social interactions, stereotyped and restricted\npatterns of behavior, interests, or activities, atypical sensory reactivity\nand profound impairment in verbal and nonverbal communication\n[7].\nThe etiology of ASD is complex and no major contributor was\nfully determined in the majority of the cases [8]. In some cases,\nthere are changes in the expression of genes associated with the\ndevelopment and function of the central nervous system, as observed\nfor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes involved\nin neural development and synaptic activities [9]. The intrauterine\nenvironment is considered a relevant factor to contribute to\nASD etiology due to the increased production of pro-inflammatory\ncytokines, which can transpose the placental barrier and affect the\ndevelopment of the central nervous system of the fetus [10-12]. The\nchanges in the brain structure of autism include deficits in the connections\namong different brain areas [13] and synapses formation\n[14, 15], as well as dysfunction of glial cells [15] and mutations in\ngenes that control several aspects of the circadian oscillations of the\nbody [16], which may include the neuroendocrine responses of this\nsystem, as for the rhythm of melatonin synthesis, which per se is an\nimportant hallmark for the regulation of endogenous rhythmic functions\n[17].", "metadata": {"name": "Dysregulation of Circadian Rhythms in Autism Spectrum Disorders", "page": 1, "pdf_id": "4a98b445-1f09-4a39-8425-dd23b7140e64"}, "id": "11"}, {"document": "learning, memory, and cognition (Sahar and Sassone-\nCorsi 2012a; Schmidt et al. 2007). Studies conducted on\nDrosophila demonstrated the involvement of circadian\ngenes in potentiating long-term memory (Sakai et al.\n2004).\nCompelling evidence now suggests important implications\nof circadian rhythm in neurodevelopment and\nneuronal functions both during prenatal and postnatal\ndevelopment. Dysregulation of the circadian system could\ninterfere with the crucial phases of brain development and\naffect neuronal migration, neurogenesis, neurotransmitter\nsignaling, as well as neuronal plasticity (Kobayashi et al.\n2015). These abnormalities could influence the manifestation\nof various neurodevelopmental disorders across\ndifferent stages of life. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a\nclassical neurodevelopmental disorder having an early\nonset, as early as 12 months of age. Altered developmental\nneurogenesis, neurotransmitter signaling, neuroplasticity,\nand brain morphometry have been proposed to contribute\nto the neurodevelopmental basis of ASD. Since circadian\ndisruption critically influences these developmental brain\nprocesses, there is a possibility that circadian disruption\ncould lead to ASD by driving neurodevelopmental abnormality.\nThere are however few studies showing a direct\ncausal link between circadian disruption and ASD risk. A\ngene expression study has reported differential expression\nof 15 circadian rhythm regulatory or responsive genes in\nsevere cases of ASD (Hu et al. 2009). Circadian changes in\nbrain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its implications\nfor cortical functions in ASD suggest a possible\nconnection between circadian clock and ASD (Katoh-\nSemba et al. 2007). A link between circadian rhythm and\nASD has also been established, based on an increased\natypical sleep rhythm, a lower number of rapid eye\nmovements (REMs) during REM sleep, longer sleep latency,\nand frequent nocturnal awakenings (Limoges et al. 2005).\nSupported by these sleep studies, the circadian aberration\ntheory is rapidly gaining attention as a risk model of ASD.\nASD is an etiologically complex and phenotypically\nheterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder. Alongside\nneurodevelopmental origins, pathways including\nimmune-inflammation, metabolic, oxidative toxicity,\nand neurotransmitter abnormalities have been linked to\nASD pathophysiology. The role of the circadian clock on\nthe functioning of these pathways and the pathobiological\nimplications of their functional interactions in\nASD are only beginning to be understood. The disruption\nof reciprocal interaction among the core components\nof circadian clock and immune, metabolic,\noxidative stress, and neurotransmitter systems might\nhave ramifications on the neurobiological sequelae and\nsymptomatology of ASD. Based on indirect evidences\nand preliminary understanding, we propose a theoretical\nmodel of a circadian disruption-induced aberrant\nimmune-metabolic-oxidative stress-neurotransmitter\naxis in ASD. Future research and experimental validation\nof this model will provide important insights into\nthe complex and multifactorial basis of ASD.\nGenetic construct of the circadian\nrhythm\nIn almost all organisms, the circadian rhythm is modulated\nby both external (environment) and internal (clock-related\ngenes) factors. The genes involved in the circadian clock\nhomeostasis are well characterized. Circadian rhythms are\ngenerated by autoregulatory transcriptional\u2013translational\nfeedback loops (TTFLs), which are driven by core transcriptional\nactivators such as circadian locomotor output\ncycles kaput (CLOCK), and brain and muscle ARNT-like\nprotein 1 (BMAL1) (Takahashi 2017). CLOCK heterodimerizes\nwith BMAL1 and acts as positive regulator of the\nloop. The CLOCK-BMAL1 complex binds to enhancer box\n(E-box) and drives rhythmic expression of the negative\nregulators, the period (PER1, PER2, and PER3), and cryptochrome\n(CRY1 and CRY2) proteins. These negative regulators\ncan dimerize themselves to form a homodimer\n(PER-PER) or heterodimer (PER-CRY). The PER-CRY heterodimer\ntranslocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and\ninhibits gene expression induced by CLOCK-BMAL1\n(Reppert and Weaver 2002). In addition to the primary\nCLOCK-BMAL1 feedback loop, there is another regulatory\nfeedback loop which is driven by retinoic acid-related\norphan nuclear receptor alpha (ROR\u03b1) and REV-ERB\u03b1.\nStudies have shown that ROR\u03b1 and REV-ERB\u03b1 regulate the\ntranscription of BMAL1 through retinoic-acid-related\norphan receptor elements (ROREs) (Guillaumond et al.\n2005). ROREs activate the transcription of BMAL1, whereas\nREV-ERBs suppress the transcription of BMAL1 and also\nrepress transcription of CLOCK and CRY1 genes (Preitner\net al. 2002). The period, phase, and amplitude of circadian\nrhythm are influenced by circadian gene variants and\nentrained by environmental factors such as exposure to\nlight, social cues, mealtimes, and work schedules.\nUnder normal circumstances, people exhibit various\ncircadian phenotypes or chronotypes. These chronotypes\nare influenced by an individual\u2019s genetic background as\nwell as environmental cues. Notably, genetic variations\nhave been reported in several clock-related genes in the\ngeneral population (Ciarleglio et al. 2008). Some of the", "metadata": {"name": "Disruption of circadian rhythm and risk of autism spectrum disorder: role of immune-inflammatory, oxidative stress, metabolic and neurotransmitter pathways", "page": 2, "pdf_id": "eac9624b-65fe-412f-b7ab-f9ea82581e16"}, "id": "51"}, {"document": "occur due to chronic changes in the availability, storage, or use of the metabolite or\ndue to disruption to the circadian modulation of homeostatic regulation.\nMetabolic disruption leads to many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular\ndiseases, obesity, diabetes, and related comorbidities. As of 2012, it is estimated\nthat half of adult population in the USA has one or more chronic health conditions\n[1], and 35% suffer from metabolic syndrome [2]. To be diagnosed with metabolic\nsyndrome, one should have at least three of the five metabolic risk factors: large\nwaistline, high triglyceride level, low HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and\nhigh fasting glucose [3]. As of now, 60% of deaths worldwide are due to\nnoninfectious chronic diseases, and it is estimated that as much as 80% of premature\nstroke, heart disease, and diabetes could be prevented [4]. An important\napproach to preventing these consequences involves restoring healthy lifestyle.\nAs the daily rhythm in activity-sleep and feeding-fasting and the dependent\nrhythms in energy metabolism are integral part of lifestyle, it is becoming increasingly\napparent that circadian regulation of metabolism has a central role in both\nprevention and prognosis of chronic metabolic diseases.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, for most part of human history, humans have\nlived with a robust daily rhythm in activity-rest and the associated rhythm in\nfeeding-fasting. Early hunter-gatherer populations often ate sparingly mostly during\nthe daytime, and, even today, these populations rarely suffer from cardiovascular\ndiseases and other metabolic complications [5]. Accordingly humans and\nanimals have developed adaptations for an intermittent food supply. This adaptive\nmechanism includes organs for the uptake and storage of rapidly mobilizable\nglucose and longer-lasting energy substrates, such as fatty acids in adipose tissue.\nBiochemical programs have also evolved to adapt to intermittent food intake:\nanabolic metabolism during feeding and catabolic metabolism during fasting.\nWith the predictable nature of feeding-fasting cycle tied to the daily cycle of\nactivity-rest, circadian oscillators have evolved to integrate ~24 h rhythms to\nanabolic and catabolic metabolism from single cell to the whole organism.\nHence, organisms have evolved to go through the cycles of feeding, energy storage,\nuse of stored energy during fasting, and trigger of hunger to reinitiate the cycle with\na bout of feeding. As modern humans are untethered from the natural light-dark\ncycle and food is plentiful, chronic disruption of this genomic program of going\nthrough intermittent daily cycle of feeding and fasting is emerging as an important\ndisruptor of metabolic homeostasis.\n21.2 Organization of Circadian System in Mammals\n21.2.1 Core Clock Players\nThe circadian clock circuitry acts to produce rhythms in behavior and physiology in\nanticipation of environmental changes.

A relationship has been reported\nbetween melatonin and light/dark variations in inflammatory systemic markers\n[70]. Melatonin may act as a potent antioxidant, reducing myocardial damage\ninduced by ischemia reperfusion. Patients with lower nocturnal concentrations of\nmelatonin appear to have a higher chance of developing heart failure or cardiac\ndeath [71]. Circadian regulation of a key transcription factor KLF15 in mammalian\nheart sustains cardiac electrical properties. Disruption (either deficiency or\noverexpression) of KLF15 causes loss of rhythmic QT variation, abnormal repolarization,\nand enhanced susceptibility of arrhythmia [72].\n21.4.4 Cancer\nEpidemiological observations have linked circadian rhythms with cancer risk.\nWomen with more hours per week and years working at night have a moderate\nincrease in breast cancer. Shift work is also increasingly associated with elevated\nrisk for cancer to a point that WHO has recognized shift work as a \u201cpotential\ncarcinogen\u201d [73]. After cancer diagnosis, prognosis is poorer in patients with\ndisrupted circadian rhythms, while chronotherapy, where timing of drug administration\nis considered during treatment, has been shown to increase efficacy of some\nchemotherapeutic agents [74, 75]. These observations in humans support an intimate\nconnection between circadian rhythm and cell cycle regulation; however, the\nmechanism appears to be more complex.\nAt least three different connections between circadian clock and cancer have\nbeen described: circadian regulation of cell cycle regulators, shared components\nbetween DNA damage response and circadian rhythm, and circadian regulation of\nmetabolism. Circadian regulation of genes related to the cell cycle creates a\ncompelling case for the involvement of circadian timing in cancer development.\nCircadian expression of WEE1 (G2/M transition) and MYC (G0/G1 transition) and\ncyclin D1 (G1/S transition) in mammals [76] can partly explain circadian gating of\ncell cycle regulation. Accordingly, partial hepatectomy-induced liver regeneration\nis slowed down in Cry1\n\u0001/\u0001\n;Cry2\n\u0001/\u0001\nmice, indicating CRY is an important link\nbetween circadian physiology and cell proliferation [76]. PER1 and PER2 have\nbeen shown to be tumor suppressors in mice, and expression of all three PER genes\nis deregulated in breast cancer [77]. Some of the effects of PER proteins in cancer\nmay relate to DNA damage response. PER1 protein can interact with DNA-damage\nresponse kinases ATM and CHK2 [78], which offer a direct link between clock\ncomponent and cancer. Another immediate responder to DNA damage is PARP\nprotein that rapidly synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) polymers and thereby depletes\ncellular NAD store. The intimate connection between NAD, SIRT, and circadian\nclock and the demonstration that genetic perturbation of PARP or SIRT pathway\naffects both circadian clock and DNA damage response offer another link between\ncancer and clock. Recently, DNA damage response has been shown to alter the\ncircadian clock via Hausp-dependent stabilization of CRY1 protein [79].", "metadata": {"name": "Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases", "page": 9, "pdf_id": "0dfc0ca6-41c5-4a69-a201-6826b91ff714"}, "id": "47"}, {"document": "systems on the risk and progression of ASD will be\ndiscussed.\nIt is now evident that monoamine neurotransmitters\nserve as modulators of circadian rhythm in the CNS.\nSeveral studies have conclusively shown serotonergic\nmodulation of circadian rhythmicity (Morin 1999). Loss of\nserotonergic neurons leads to the earlier onset and late\noffset of nocturnal activity and increased sensitivity of\ncircadian rhythm to light (Morin 1999). Monoamine neurotransmitters\nare also shown to mediate circadianinduced\nalterations in mood and behavior (Kim et al.\n2017). In a study on rats, circadian disruption was shown to\ninfluence the levels of neurotransmitters and behavior.\nRats with circadian rhythm disruption had decreased\nlevels of serotonin and showed anxious behaviors (Matsumura\net al. 2015).\nCircadian control of dopaminergic activity and\nmodulatory effects of dopamine in maintaining proper\ncircadian rhythmicity in different brain areas by influencing\nclock genes and proteins is widely recognized\n(Korshunov et al. 2017). Diurnal variations exist in the\nlevels of dopamine transporter (DAT), tyrosine hydroxylase\n(TH) in the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens,\nand caudate, and these changes are dependent on\nSCN regulation (Sleipness et al. 2007). The concentrations\nof dopamine, glutamate and GABA in the rat nucleus\naccumbens show circadian rhythms (Castaneda et al.\n2004). An altered dopamine circuit due to circadian\ndisruption has implications in behavioral abnormalities\nand psychopathology (Verwey et al. 2016). Knockdown of\nthe CLOCK gene in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of mice\nled to increased dopaminergic activity and resulted in\nmanic episodes (Mukherjee et al. 2010). Mice with a CLOCK\nmutation had increased dopaminergic activity in the VTA,\nand this was associated with mania-like behavior: however,\nbehavioral abnormalities were rescued by expressing\na functional CLOCK protein in the VTA (Roybal et al. 2007).\nPossible mechanisms\nSeveral independent lines of research support the\nhypothesis that dysfunctional neurotransmitter systems\nare involved in the etiology of ASD (Chugani 2012). The\nmonoamine neurotransmitters such as GABA, serotonin,\ndopamine, and glutamate have long been implicated in\nASD pathogenesis (DiCarlo et al. 2019; Hamilton et al.\n2013; Horder et al. 2018). Though a direct causal link is yet\nto be established, multiple studies indicate a possible role\nof chronic circadian disruption in inducing neurochemical\nand neuroplasticity changes in ASD. Such evidences\ninclude:\ni) Serotonin is a precursor of melatonin and dysregulations\nof serotonin can cause abnormal production of\nmelatonin. Hyperserotonemia leads to a lowered production\nof melatonin which in turn causes disturbances\nin the circadian rhythm. Some studies reported that\nalmost one-third of ASD patients have hyperserotonemia\n(Croonenberghs et al. 2007; Kolevzon et al.\n2010).\nDevelopmental disruption of the serotonin systems alters\ncircadian rhythms (Paulus and Mintz 2012). Disruptions of\nserotonin signaling during early brain development might\nbe involved in ASD (Yang et al. 2014). Thus, developmental\ndysregulations of serotonin systems and circadian clock\nmight be linked to ASD risk.\nii) A possible functional interaction between synaptic and\nclock genes has been proposed in the risk of ASD\n(Bourgeron 2007). It is noteworthy that synaptic plasticity\nalso varies with a 24-h rhythm. Disruption of\ncircadian rhythm affects synaptic plasticity. It is\nbecoming increasingly apparent that the clock machinery\nin the brain controls the genes of synaptic components\nlike neuropeptides, neurotransmitter regulators,\nreceptors and transporters, ion channels, vesicle proteins,\nadhesion and scaffolding proteins, implying that\nthe clock machinery influences synaptic plasticity\nthrough transcriptional control (Hannou et al. 2020).\nEpigenetic influence on circadian\nrhythmicity and ASD\nEpigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, histone\nmodification and noncoding RNA, like microRNA (miRNA)\nalterations respond promptly to environmental changes.\nInterestingly, rhythmicity in epigenetic events is evident in\ncells and tissues. The circadian system also has a significant\ninfluence on many epigenetic regulators. Epigenetic\nprocesses also have robust impacts on sleep patterns. Lack\nof sleep only for a single night alters both DNA methylation\nand the transcriptional profile of key circadian genes\n(Cedernaes et al. 2015). Altered DNA methylation seems to\ninfluence susceptibility to autism (Tremblay and Jiang\n2019).\nSleep loss has a profound impact on epigenetic modifications\nof circadian genes. This can confer risk to ASD\nand may influence the severity of ASD. Besides DNA\nmethylation, miRNAs, the endogenous single-stranded,\nnoncoding RNA molecules regulate gene expression\nnegatively and post transcriptionally. miRNAs are involved", "metadata": {"name": "Disruption of circadian rhythm and risk of autism spectrum disorder: role of immune-inflammatory, oxidative stress, metabolic and neurotransmitter pathways", "page": 9, "pdf_id": "eac9624b-65fe-412f-b7ab-f9ea82581e16"}, "id": "58"}, {"document": "Schumann et al. 2004). Many studies point towards\nabnormal melatonin synthesis in ASD (Melke et al. 2008;\nWuet al. 2020). There have been many reports of decreased\nnight time melatonin levels in autistic children. This is\ncorrelated with the physiological abnormalities including\nsleep onset latency, lower total sleep time in patients with\nautism (Limoges et al. 2005), and lower REM sleep (Buckley\net al. 2010). Genetic studies have also supported a role of\nmelatonin in ASD. Acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase\n(ASMT) is the last enzyme of the melatonin synthesis\npathway. Splice site mutation in ASMT (IVS5+2T>C) is\nassociated with ASD, indicating a potential involvement of\nthis gene in ASD (Jonsson et al. 2010). Genetic variations\nwithin the melatonin receptor (MTNR1N and MTNR1B)\ngenes were also reported in ASD (Chaste et al. 2010). The\ngenetic variants within the melatonin pathway enzymes,\nASMT and cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) were also associated\nwith sleep onset delay in ASD (Veatch et al. 2015).\nAltered activity of the hypothalamic\u2013\npituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis\nThe hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis and the\ncircadian clock system regulate each other\u2019s activity at\nmultiple levels (Nader et al. 2010). The HPA axis is crucially\ninvolved in stress responsivity. This is mediated by the\nrelease of glucocorticoid hormones from the adrenal cortex.\nCortisol (hydrocortisone) is the primary glucocorticoid\nin humans. Cortisol shows pronounced diurnal variations,\npeaking in the early morning and reaching its lowest level\nin the evening (Pruessner et al. 1997; Weitzman et al. 1971).\nA dysfunctional HPA axis and altered levels of cortisol are\nreported in the blood, serum, and saliva of patients with\nASD and are also shown to influence the severity of ASD\n(Curin et al. 2003; Lakshmi Priya et al. 2013; Spratt et al.\n2012; Tordjman et al. 2014). Changes in cortisol circadian\nrhythms have been reported, in the children with ASD, with\nlower cortisol levels in the morning and higher levels in the\nevening (Corbett et al. 2008).\nCircadian disruption and risk of\nASD: possible underlying\nmechanisms\nDisruption of circadian rhythms may lead to desynchronization\nof several physiological processes. This includes\naugmented inflammatory activity and diminished\nimmunological defenses, aberrant functioning of\nneuroendocrine stress responses, excessive generation of\nreactive oxygen species (ROS), disrupted neurotransmission,\nand synaptic plasticity. All these changes have\npathobiological relevance in ASD. The implications of\ncircadian disruption on these pathways and their possible\nimpact onASD risk are discussed in the following sections\nand summarized in Figure 1.\nCircadian rhythm, development, and ASD\nrisk\nConverging findings in offsprings suggest an association\nbetween early neurodevelopmental abnormalities and risk of\nASD (Livingston and Happe 2017; Xiao et al. 2014). The core\nelements of the circadian clock regulate brain development.\nPER3 is a critical component of the circadian clock and its\nexpression has been reported in mouse cerebral cortex during\nembryonic to postnatal development. PER3 is crucial in\nregulating corticogenesis, and PER3 deficiency affects\nneuronal migration in the developing brain (Noda et al.\n2019). In addition to this, another circadian gene, Nr1d1\n(Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1), also\nknown as REV-ERB\u03b1 plays an important role in the regulation\nof excitatory neuron migration and synaptic network\nformation (Goto et al. 2017).

This can result in a circadian dysregulation\nof both mother and children since the daily variation of melatonin\nlevels is one of the factors that sets the SCN to a 24-hour\ncycle and therefore is crucial for appropriate regulation of several\nphysiological rhythms including sleep/wake cycle. Indeed, albeit\nglucocorticoids, melatonin is a well-known hormone to feedback to\nthe SCN and reset the oscillation of the clock gene machinery [174,\n190]. Because the increase in sleep propensity [191] and the reduction\nof body temperature [192] at night should occur after the nocturnal\nmelatonin rise, lack of melatonin at night may affect the adjusting\nof the temporal organization at several physiological processes,\nsuch as immune responses [193], energy metabolism [194]\nand proper neural function [100].\nIndeed, several aspects of body physiology occur under the\ndaily synchronicity driven by melatonin. In metabolism, the decreased\nmelatonin has consequences for energy homeostasis and the\nlocal temporal-controlling system [190]. Mice lacking both MT1\nand MT2 receptors show alterations in the daily profile of clock\ngene expression in the pancreas and the liver [195]; Furthermore,\npinealectomy impairs insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis [196].\nThus, impacting melatonin production also has consequences in\nenergy homeostasis. Regarding the regulation of immune functions\n[96, 97] long-lasting disruptions of melatonin signal suppress clock\ngene oscillation in the spleen, a pattern currently observed in diabetes,\nand neuroinflammatory responses [197] suggesting that the\nfine-tuning of the rhythmic nocturnal production of melatonin is\nimportant for the maintenance of several aspects of human physiology.\nMelatonin also regulates the functional activity of pituitary\npars tuberalis through MT1 receptors, which transmit signals controlling\nthe production of thyroid hormones, as well as to prolactin\nsecretion [198]. Lack of neuroendocrine responses of melatonin is\nalso related to increased lipogenesis [199] and the regulation of\nperipheral oscillation of the clock gene expression in the adipose\ntissue [200].\nAltogether, we have reviewed the major contributions of the\ncircadian rhythms in the normal-developed subject and ASD individuals.\nWe discussed that ASD individuals might have several\npoints of impairment of brain development and maturation within\nthe control of areas that regulate circadian rhythms. Two pivotal\nareas, the SCN and the pineal gland, are two target areas of the\nbrain, interconnected, that drive several aspects of the human\nrhythms, which has consequences for behavioral phenotypes, including\nsleep regulation, memory formation, immune quiescence,\nand metabolic fitness.\nOur current hypothesis highlights the need of the early diagnosis\nof simultaneous measures of melatonin and TNF, which may be\nachieved by non-invasive methodology, and thus, improving the\ndata for supporting clinical pharmacological intervention based on\nmelatonin or analogs to improve the well-known outcomes of neurological\ndisturbances observed in ASD subjects, as sleep disturbances,\ndeficits in cognition and behavioral issues.\nCONCLUSION\nCurrent evidence supports the existence of associations among\nASD, clock gene mutations, abnormal rhythmic secretion of melatonin\nand glucocorticoids, sleep disorders, behavioral problems, and\nincreased inflammation. Although the direction of causality remains\nelusive, much of this evidence can be correlated based on lack of\nnocturnal melatonin production, as exogenous melatonin improves\nsleep, synchronizes clock gene expression in several tissues, and\nregulates the immune system. Correlational evidence calls for improving\nthe diagnosis regarding the chronobiological aspects of\nASD, which includes beneficial aspects for improving the detection\nof behavioral problems, aspects of the daily activities and a clear\ntrack about the drugs in use along with non-obvious aspects of ASD\ntreatment, including timely use of melatonin and analogs, which\ncould complement the treatment of ASD.\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS\nAANAT = aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase\nACTH = adrenocorticotropic hormone\nADHD = attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\naMT6s = urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin\nASMT = acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase\ncAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate\nCSF = cerebrospinal fluid\nCREB = cAMP response element-binding protein\nFMR = fragile X mental retardation\nLPS = lipopolysaccharide\nLTP = long-term potentiation\nNAS = N-acetylserotonin\nNF-\u03baB = nuclear factor kappa B\nNPAS = neuronal PAS domain protein\nNR1D1 = nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1\nNREM = non-rapid eye movement\nPKA = cAMP-dependent protein kinase\nPKC = protein kinase C\nPVN = paraventricular nucleus\nSCG = superior cervical ganglion\nSCN = suprachiasmatic nucleus\nSNP = single nucleotide polymorphisms\nSWS = slow-wave sleep\nTNF = tumor necrosis factor\nTPH = tryptophan hydroxylase\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by grants from the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo\n\u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP 11/51495-4) to\nLP and by FAPESP 2013/13691-1, Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento\nde Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)\nand Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico\n(CNPq 480097/2013-5) to RPM.

NAD+ level shows daily oscillations in the liver, likely due to\noscillations in Nampt transcription [32, 33]. NAD+ levels also vary in response to\nDNA damage, via damage-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1),\nwhich acts to reduce NAD+ levels [34]. PARP normally has rhythmic accumulation\nin the liver. Additionally, in day-fed rodents, PARP oscillation is inverted,\nsuggesting circadian patterns of PARP are food dependent. In the absence of\nPARP activity, the hepatic clock takes a long time to readjust to a shifted feeding\nwindow, suggesting PARP plays an important role in the phase entrainment of liver\noscillators [35]. PARP activity directly impacts NAD+ levels, which can subsequently\naffect sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases that impact a\nmultitude of metabolic pathways and the circadian clock.\nSIRT1 participates in cross talk with FoxO genes, providing a mechanism by\nwhich SIRT impacts metabolic pathways. During long-term fasting, NAD+ levels\nincrease, which upregulates SIRT activity. This leads to deacetylation and activation\nof FoxO, which in turn impacts an array of metabolic pathways [36\u201338].\nAdditionally, NAD+-activated SIRT1 deacetylates and destabilizes sterol regulatory\nelement-binding protein (SREBP), a transcription factor that upregulates\nsynthesis of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis. The destabilization causes\nSREBP to build up and increase fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis [39]. The\nincrease in sterols and fatty acids means an increase in ligands for nuclear receptors\nlike PPAR and ROR (discussed in more detail in the next section). These can act on\nthe CLOCK/BMAL system directly or via effects on PER/CRY accumulation,\nmodulating the feedback pathway.\nWorth noting, there are many other pathways by which SIRT can influence\nmetabolism. Sirt1 can act on STAT3 in gluconeogenesis, NFKB in insulin secretion\nand sensitivity, LXR in lipid metabolism, CRTC2 in gluconeogenesis, and PGC1a\nin gluconeogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (reviewed in [40]). SIRT1 acts both as a\nsensor and regulator of metabolic pathways. The fact that it is regulated by\ncircadian expression of NAD+, combined with its ability to influence pathways\nthat regulate the core clock system, puts SIRT1 at an important node of the cross\ntalk between metabolism and circadian circuitry [41].\n21.3.3 Nuclear Receptor Pathways: PPAR, Reverb, ROR\nIn the mouse genome, 20 of the 49 nuclear receptor genes are expressed in a\ncircadian manner, and nearly all of these nuclear hormone receptors implicated in\nmetabolic processes [42]. Several of these are also implicated in clock machinery,\neither directly or indirectly. These include, among others, PPAR, REVERB\nand ROR.\nAs mentioned earlier, ROR proteins are activators of Bmal1 transcription.\nREVERB inhibits ROR function by competing for the same DNA binding site\nand thus inhibits Bmal1 transcription, thereby producing rhythmic levels of Bmal1\nmRNA.

Organization of the circadian timing system: cyclic variation in the environmental light (day and night) are sensed by melanopsin-expressing photoreceptors\nin the retina (retinal ganglion cells) which project this information through neurotransmission to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus,\nvia retinohypothalamic tract, thus synchronizing the transcription and activity of the clock gene machinery. From the SCN, major control of neuroendocrine\nrhythms is due to projections to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus, which regulates the synthesis of cortisol and melatonin in a phasedependent\nmanner. For the synthesis of cortisol, major effects are due to the control of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the secretion of adrenocorticotropic\nhormone (ACTH), that via systemic circulation acts on the adrenal gland cortex (red lines). The other pathway occurs via the neural pathway, where\nPVN stimulatory neurotransmission, via the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland (not shown in the schematic\nrepresentation). The neural integration from the SCN for allowing the pineal gland (Pi) synthesis of melatonin involves a multi-synaptic pathway that links the\nSCN, paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), where postganglionic axons emerge to the gland through the pineal stalk and\nrelease norepinephrine directly into pineal gland at the dark phase. In humans, the peak of cortisol in the circulation occurs in the transition between dark to the\nlight phase, thus informing the onset of activity, whereas the peak of melatonin occurs only in the presence of darkness and plays major effects in the orchestration\nof nocturnal rhythms of humans. (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).\nIt is interesting to note that in most mammals, the rhythmic\nproduction of these hormones occurs in specific phases, which generates\npatterns in the production and action of these hormones. In\ngeneral, the increase in glucocorticoid synthesis and secretion precedes\nthe activity phase of the species, while melatonin production\noccurs systematically during the dark phase in most species. Also,\nto promote proper timing of the organism to the environment, crosscommunication\nin the actions of glucocorticoids and melatonin may\nallow responses that suit the organism's rhythmic events. Under\nphysiological conditions, the reciprocal synchronization between\nadrenal and pineal gland activity in rats is of great relevance for the\nregulation of different physiological responses, which demonstrates\nthe existence of a cross-communication between the rhythmic activities\nof these two glands [68]. In species that exhibit diurnal activity,\nsuch as humans, an increase in the cortisol plasma content is\nobserved in the morning, maintaining melatonin production at\nnight. Thus, the synchronization of the organism's rhythmic patterns\nto a single synchronizer (SCN) orchestrates the proper functioning\nof structures and tissues that allow their respective activities in a\ntime-regulated manner.\nDuring the light phase of the day, the SCN oscillation inhibits\nPVN-to-SCG neural activity by GABAergic neurotransmission. At\nnight, glutamatergic-excitatory neurotransmission activates PVN\nneurons. The dorsal and lateral neurons of PVN are the main projections\nto reach the neurons in the SCG [69]. Thus, major deficits\nin intra-uterine development of these brain areas may impact the\nnocturnal synthesis of melatonin. The dense pineal innervation by\nthe sympathetic postganglionic axons triggers the nocturnal release\nof noradrenaline [70] and ATP co-transmission [71]. Many neurotransmitters\noriginated from other brain areas may also contribute to\nthe regulation of melatonin synthesis [72]. However, the orchestration\nof noradrenaline release is timely linked to the nocturnal rise of\nmelatonin production by the catecholamine action on \u03b21-\nadrenoceptors, which are densely present in pinealocytes, the melatonin-\nsynthesizing cells [73] (Fig. 1).\nActivation of \u03b21-adrenoceptors in pinealocytes is translated into\nthe activation of stimulatory G-coupled protein and formation of\ncyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which activates the\ncAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) that plays two major roles:\nfirstly, it phosphorylates cAMP response element-binding protein\n(CREB) which binds to responsive elements in the promoter of the\naralkylamine N-acetyltransferase gene (Aanat), starting its transcription\n[74, 75]. After translation, AANAT is phosphorylated by\nPKA, allowing its interaction to chaperone 14-3-3, and activity. In\nvitro studies have shown that the activation of \u03b11-adrenoceptors\n[66] and purinergic P2Y1 receptors by ATP [71, 76] increases\nCa2+-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) activation, potentiating\nmelatonin formation [77, 78].\nThe nocturnal synthesis of melatonin relies on active intake of\nthe essential amino acid tryptophan from circulation [79], which is\nactively hydroxylated by tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) [80]\nand decarboxylated by the enzyme aromatic amino acid decarboxylase\nto serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) formation [81].

These mice are obese and develop a\nmetabolic syndrome [53]. Likewise, adipocyte-specific Bmal1-null mice exhibit\nincreased food intake during the light phase and increased body weight [54]. These\nexperiments provide a link between disruption of clock components and metabolic\npathologies.\n21.4.2 Inflammation\nA common feature of a vast majority of chronic diseases is an increase in local or\nsystemic inflammation marked by increased sensitivity of immune system to\nantigens and elevated levels of cytokines, lymphocytes, or macrophages in circulation\nor in specific tissue types. Circadian regulation in immune function is\nsupported by observations in both animals and humans. Experimentally induced\ncircadian disruption alters innate immune responses, with heightened release of\npro-inflammatory cytokines in response to endotoxic shock in shifted mice vs. -\nnon-shifted controls [55, 56]. In humans, dysregulation of the sleep/wake cycle\naffects the number of circulating lymphocytes [57]. These immune changes are\nlikely mediators in many of the adverse health effects seen from circadian disruption,\nas inflammatory responses have been implicated as risk factors in multiple\ndiseases including obesity, diabetes, IR, cancers, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular\ncomplications.\nBoth immune cell proliferation (maturation, activation, trafficking) and immune\ncell function may be affected by circadian clock components. Proliferation and\nrelease of mature lymphocytes from bone marrow have been shown to be circadian\n[58]. Several trafficking factors including CXCL1 and SDF1 are also regulated in a\ncircadian manner, and this regulation is likely mediated by JARID1a [59], which\nalso modulates CLOCK/BMAL1 function [60]. Additionally, transcriptional regulators\nDEC1 and ROR-gamma have been implicated in both circadian regulation\nand lymphocyte maturation [61]. In differentiated cells, the function of the major\nimmune regulator NF-kappaB is inhibited by CRY proteins, so that Cry-deficient\nmice show elevated levels of IL6 and succumb to LPS challenge [62]. Circadian\nregulation of immune function is not limited to a handful of genes. Genome-wide\ntranscriptome studies have found hundreds of genes that are expressed in a circadian\nmanner in mature macrophages [63].\n21.4.3 Cardiovascular Complications\nSimilar to other systems, the cardiovascular system exhibits daily and seasonal\nrhythms.

The\ncomponents of the circadian rhythm play pivotal roles in\nthe regulation of neurodevelopment, neurotransmission,\nneuronal plasticity, sleep, and learning and memory.\nTherefore, circadian rhythms potentially regulate multiple\ncore neurophysiological processes that are relevant to\nbehavior. Aberrations in circadian rhythm and the consequent\nneurobiological processes may drive various brain\ndisorders across the lifespan (Logan and McClung 2019).\nFor example, dysregulation of neurotransmitters like\ndopamine by circadian clock components has profound\nimpacts on mood and addiction (Hampp et al. 2008; Kim\net al. 2017; Parekh et al. 2015).\nCircadian dysregulation in ASD:\na review of evidence\nThe first indication that the circadian rhythm might be\naffected in ASD was reported almost 50 years ago when\nRitvo et al. observed an abnormal increase in serotonin\nlevels in the blood of autistic individuals compared with\nage-matched controls (Ritvo et al. 1970). Subsequently,\nmany studies highlighted the relevance of circadian\ndisruption in the risk and progression of ASD. Genetic\nstudies have provided important insights into the role of\ngenetic determinants of the circadian clock in the risk\nASD. Considerable genetic variation exists within the\ncoding region of human circadian rhythm genes such as\nPER1, PER2, PER3, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear\ntranslocator-like protein 1(ARNTL), CRY2, CLOCK, and\nTIMELESS (Hawkins et al. 2008). Converging evidence\nsuggests that CLOCK genes play an important role in ASD\n(Wimpory et al. 2002). Contextually, circadian genes are\nhighly polymorphic in ASD (Yang et al. 2016). In a study\non single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 11 CLOCK/\nCLOCK-related genes, PER1 and neuronal PAS domain\nprotein 2 (NPAS2) were significantly associated with ASD\n(Nicholas et al. 2007). The possible association between\ncircadian abnormality and the risk of ASD has been discussed\nin the following sections.\nAltered sleep\u2013wake cycle and disrupted\nmelatonin biosynthesis\nSleep disturbance and circadian sleep alterations are\ncommon or the most frequently associated comorbid condition\nin children with ASD. Multiple factors seem to drive\nthe sleep disturbances in people with ASD (Glickman 2010;\nRana et al. 2021). Circadian sleep dysrhythmicity may\npredispose children to ASD symptoms (Carmassi et al.\n2019). Neonatal abnormal sleep\u2013wake rhythm may be a\npredictor of future development of ASD (Miike et al. 2020).\nSleep disturbances may precede and worsen the behavioral\noutcomes in children with ASD. For example, disturbances\nin continuous sleep and circadian rhythms have\nbeen linked to behavioral difficulties such as high irritability\nas well as high stereotypic behaviors in children with\nASD (Yavuz-Kodat et al. 2020). Autistic traits in toddlers\nwere recently associated with sleep problems, particularly\ndaytime sleepiness (Horiuchi et al. 2020). REM sleep has\nbeen postulated as an index of brain plasticity (Elia et al.\n2000). Impaired REM sleep can thus be considered as a\nmarker of abnormal brain functioning. Contextually,\npersistent sleep disturbance was associated with neuronal\ndamage and impaired brain development (Jan et al. 2010;\nMacDuffie et al. 2020). A correlation between altered\nsubcortical brain volumes and sleep onset problems in first\ntwo years of life may predispose infants to ASD; this further\nimplies the neurodevelopmental connection of sleep\nabnormality in children with ASD (MacDuffie et al. 2020).\nInterestingly, genes regulating the circadian rhythm also\naffect sleep behavior (Patke et al. 2017). SHANK3, a\ncandidate gene of ASD modulates sleep as well as the\nexpression of the circadian transcription factors like PER3,\nBhlhe41, Hlf, Tef, and Nr1d1 in mouse (Ingiosi et al. 2019).\nThus, sleep can be considered as a translationally-relevant\nendpoint in ASD pathobiology and therapeutics (Missig\net al. 2020).\nMelatonin is involved in an arsenal of pathways in the\nhuman body; foremost among them is the regulation of the\ncircadian rhythm and sleep\u2013wake cycle (Cajochen et al.\n2003). Melatonin has neuroprotective effects and it is\nessential for normal neurodevelopment (Jin et al. 2018).\nStudies on rodent hippocampus have shown that fluctuating\nmelatonin levels have a significant effect on synaptic\nplasticity (Hogan et al. 2001), and long-term potentiation in\nthe hippocampus (Wang et al. 2005). Hippocampal\ndysfunction, as well as altered synaptic plasticity, is\nimplicated in ASD (Dager et al. 2007; Guang et al. 2018;", "metadata": {"name": "Disruption of circadian rhythm and risk of autism spectrum disorder: role of immune-inflammatory, oxidative stress, metabolic and neurotransmitter pathways", "page": 4, "pdf_id": "eac9624b-65fe-412f-b7ab-f9ea82581e16"}, "id": "53"}, {"document": "Table 2.

The reason for the different blue peak intensities\nis that the color coordinates of white light corresponding to\neach CCT are considerably different. Figure 5b shows the\ncolor coordinates of the daytime HC-LEDs for melatonin\nsuppression. It can be seen that the color coordinates of the\nLEDs with a CCT of 3000 to 6500 K were very close to the\nPlanckian locus. Specifically, the Duv values for these six types\nof LEDs are extremely low, ranging from \u22120.0009 to 0.0036. In\naddition, it was confirmed that the M/P ratio of the daytime\nHC-LEDs was improved by 20 to 26% compared to that of c-\nLEDs having the same CCT and similar structure (Figure S1).\nAs a result, these HCL spectra can facilitate daytime melatonin\nsuppression. Meanwhile, HC-LEDs were designed based on\nthe M/P ratio, but according to the CIE standard newly\nestablished in 2018, this ratio can be replaced by the melanopic\ndaylight efficacy ratio (DER).32 In brief, the melanopic DER is\nexpressed as the ratio of melanopic equivalent daylight\nilluminance (EDI) to photopic illuminance, and the melanopic\nEDI is a quantitative expression of nonvisual effects by ipRGC\nbased on illuminant D65. Although the spectrum used in the\nEML (Nz(\u03bb)) and the spectrum used in the melanopic EDI\n(melanopic action spectrum; smel(\u03bb)) are not different, the M/\nP ratio and melanopic DER have slightly different values due to\ndifferent criteria. For example, the M/P ratio of the daytime\nHC-LED with a CCT of 5000 K was 1.01, whereas the\nmelanopic DER was 0.937; this means that the nonvisual\neffects on humans is 93.7% relative to illuminance D65 with a\nCCT of 6500 K. As the CCT increased, the proportion of blue\nlight constituting the white light also increased, and thus the\nmelanopic DER also increased. The luminous flux (LF) values\nwere recorded from 109 to 126 lm, which are sufficient for\nindoor lighting depending on the CCT at an applied current of\n150 mA.\nThe aforementioned daytime HC-LED packages were\nenhanced with a peak intensity of 480 nm for melatonin\nsuppression. However, for the spectrum suitable for the night,\nthe lower intensity in the 480 nm wavelength region is better\nin terms of melatonin secretion and circadian rhythm.\nExposure to bright light at nighttime, particularly high-intensity\nlight with a wavelength of 480 nm, can lower melatonin levels,\nresulting in poor sleep quality.33 For this purpose, unlike the\ndaytime HC-LED with an enhanced peak in the 480 nm\nwavelength region, a nighttime HC-LED with a reduced peak\nin the same wavelength region was also developed. The\nperformance, including the optical properties of the nighttime\nHC-LED, is summarized in Table 3. Figure 6a shows the EL\nspectra of the nighttime HC-LEDs with a CCT of 1800 to\n4000 K prepared for melatonin secretion. In the case of the\nnighttime HC-LED, the peak intensity in a wavelength region\nof 480 nm was reduced by using a different phosphor with a\nnarrow full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 50 nm instead of\nthe phosphor with a FHWM of 100 nm used in the\nconventional white LED for lighting. Similar to the CCT of\nthe daytime HC-LED series, it can be seen that the CCT\nvalues of nighttime HC-LEDs were very close to the Planckian\nlocus, as shown in Figure 6b.\nTable 3.

Additionally, the metabolic states can be\ncommunicated to and modulated by glucose-sensing pathways, NAD+ sensing\npathways, and nuclear receptor pathways.\n21.3.1 Glucose Homeostasis\nCLOCK/BMAL1 plays an integral role in glucose homeostasis. The clock circuitry\ncan both act on and respond to glucose levels. BMAL1 itself promotes hepatic\ngluconeogenesis [25, 26], and there are many additional indirect pathways by\nwhich clock is involved in glucose regulation. As previously stated, CLOCK/\nBMAL1 activates CRY and PER genes, which are heavily implicated in glucose\nsensing and regulation, via interactions with AMPK, CREB, KLF10, and insulin\npathways.\nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a sensor for the ratio of\nAMP/ATP within cells, putting it at the center of cellular energy homeostasis\n[27]. Increase in this ratio will lead to phosphorylation and activation of AMPK.\nAMPK activation leads to increased glucose uptake and decreased gluconeogenesis.\nIt is also implicated in hepatic fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis,\nand insulin sensitivity. There is a consensus motif for phosphorylation of AMPK\nwithin CRY, so that phosphorylation of AMPK leads to phosphorylation and\ndestabilization of CRY/PER complexes, disrupting their accumulation and thus\nderepression of the CLOCK complex [28]. This provides one pathway that communicates\nmetabolic state to the CLOCK circuitry.\nCREB also acts in glucose regulation via its action on gluconeogenesis. Fasting\nstate leads to glucagon binding to its membrane receptor in hepatocytes, which\nactivates a downstream G protein Gs and increases intracellular cAMP levels,\nleading to the phosphorylation of CREB [29]. pCREB shows robust rhythmic\nexpression in the liver and acts to increase gluconeogenesis. CRY can also interact\nwith Gs or adenylate cyclase to regulate temporal expression of pCREB and thus\ntemporal regulation of gluconeogenesis [30]. In this way, clock genes provide\nimportant regulation in glucose homeostasis.\nConversely, there are also pathways by which glucose levels can affect clock\naction. The mRNA accumulation of KLF10, a negatively acting Zn2+ finger transcription\nfactor, follows a diurnal rhythm in mouse liver that may be driven by\nintracellular glucose concentrations. Increased glucose upregulates KLF10, which\nbinds to BMAL1 promoter and dampens BMAL transcription [31].\n21.3.2 NAD+ Sensing Pathways\nNAD+ levels fluctuate with metabolic state.

As the night\nprogressed, there was a clear difference in melatonin levels,\ndepending on the lighting environment. At 02:00, the average\nmelatonin level increased by 2.199 pg/mL in the HC-LED\nlighting environment, which increased by 12.2% compared to\nthe c-LED lighting environment (p = 0.039). In addition, even\nafter an additional hour, the level was, on average, 1.864 pg/\nmL higher in the HC-LED lighting environment (p = 0.042).\nThis indicates that the HC-LED lighting environment with a\nregulated wavelength of 480 nm can be more favorable for\nnocturnal melatonin secretion than the c-LED lighting\nenvironment. As documented in many previous studies, lightinduced\nmelatonin control is not new; however, an obvious\ndifference between the protocol used in the previous studies\nrelated to circadian rhythm such as research on melatonin and\ncore body temperature (CBT), the CR is performed in a\nsemirecumbent posture under a dim light condition for at least\n24 h to minimize external influences.1\u22123,38\u221240 Instead of this\nCR phase, the present study set up an acclimation phase for\napproximately 1 day under the same light environment as the\nspecified protocol. Nevertheless, the significant difference in\nmelatonin levels according to the lighting environment shows\nthat melatonin can be controlled by indoor lighting in a regular\nand habitual routine. Interestingly, the melatonin level was\nreversed before and after waking up according to the lighting\nenvironment. Immediately after waking up, the melatonin level\nin the HC-LED lighting environment was 3.156 pg/mL lower\nthan that in the c-LED lighting environment, representing a\n21.9% decrease compared to that in the c-LED lighting\nenvironment (p = 0.025). In the case of circadian rhythm\nphase shifts, data measured under dim light conditions are\nrequired for an accurate evaluation. In this regard, the protocol\nused in this study may not be suitable for identifying phase\nshifts. In addition, because of the complex light conditions\n(daytime and nighttime) included in a 50 h set, further\nresearch should be conducted to determine at which time of\nday the light environment has a greater effect on melatonin\nlevels and secretion time. Nonetheless, given the nature of\nmelatonin reaching its peak concentration between 01:00 and\n04:00,41 it can be inferred that the melatonin phase was\nadvanced in participants placed in the HC-LED lighting\nenvironment.\nMany previous studies have demonstrated the effects of\nwavelength and intensity of lighting on melatonin secretion.\n42\u221245 A decrease in melatonin levels during the daytime\ncould translate into increased vitality and work efficiency, and a\nnighttime increase in melatonin could enhance bodily\nrelaxation and improve sleep quality.34,46,47 To discuss the\ndisturbance of circadian rhythm, not only the wavelength of\nlight exposed at night but also the light intensity must be\nconsidered. In this case, the light intensity at eye level, i.e.\nvertical illuminance, is considered more important.48 Rea et\nal.49 proposed a melatonin suppression response function by\nlight, called circadian stimulus (CS). Assuming that the\nparticipants were reading a book while obliquely leaning on\na bed, the CS values of daytime c- and HC-LED lighting\nenvironments were 0.207 and 0.242, respectively, and thus, the\nCS value was 16.9% higher for the HC-LED than for the c-\nLED. In addition, in the case of the nighttime lighting\nenvironment, the CS value of the HC-LED lighting environment\n(0.036) was 23.4% lower than that of the c-LED lighting\nenvironment (0.047). These results are reasonable because the\nM/P ratios of daytime and nighttime HC-LEDs were designed\ndifferently compared with the c-LEDs. Therefore, it is\nanticipated that use of the developed HC-LED would help\nmaintain a healthy circadian rhythm by further suppressing\nmelatonin during the daytime and increasing melatonin\nsecretion at nighttime.50\u221253 However, in the 50 h protocol,\nthe participants were not restricted in their behavior, and thus,\nthe vertical illuminance and CS value could vary depending on\ntheir position, gaze, and posture. In addition, the vertical\nilluminance varies greatly depending on the characteristics of\nthe room, such as the size of the room, the reflectance of the\nwall, and the location of the lighting. In this regard, a\nmeasurement method to quantify the efficiency of a luminaire\nto reach a certain level of CS based on a standard observer has\nbeen proposed.54 Students or office workers who spend most\nof their day indoors are more exposed to artificial lighting than\nnatural light, and thus, this test procedure is anticipated to\nfurther facilitate the design of indoor lighting to manage\ncircadian rhythm. In particular, the corneal blue light\ntransmittance of adolescents is higher than that of adults,\nand this should be considered in the design of indoor\nlighting.55 Consequently, for a healthy daily life with an\nenvironment of abundant exposure to artificial light, indoor\nlighting should be designed with an appropriate wavelength\nand intensity, considering who will use it and when.\nMeanwhile, our HC-LEDs were developed for indoor\nlighting, but the concept of using two chips emitting blue\nlight of two different wavelengths can be applied to the display\nfield as well. Most displays, including smartphones, televisions,\nand monitors, support a mode for blocking blue light at night\n(BLAN), but there is no mode that can quickly suppress\nmelatonin by enhancing blue light during the daytime. For this,\nthe nighttime HC-LED concept should be considered to\nminimize nocturnal melatonin suppression. The BLAN\nblocking mode is mostly achieved by reducing the intensity\nof blue light with a wavelength of 450 nm, which is mostly\nused in displays, resulting in a decrease in the CCT of white\nlight due to the low blue light ratio. However, if blue lighting\nwith a wavelength of 480 nm can be controlled, an identical\neffect can be obtained even at a relatively high CCT. Of course,\nthere are aspects that should be considered first for the display\nperformance, such as resolution, color gamut, and luminance;\nnevertheless, these attempts to apply HCL to the display can\nbe sufficiently made from the perspective of the user\u2019s circadian\nrhythm.Although further studies on circadian rhythm and\nartificial light sources are needed, for the human circadian\nrhythm, there is a need for universal use of HCL, which is\nscalable to more fields, from daytime/nighttime indoor lighting\nto display applications.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nHC-LEDs were designed to enhance or reduce the melanopic\ncurve area close to 480 nm based on light exposure time\nperiods. As a result of testing melatonin levels in 22 Korean\nmale participants, it was found that the HCL environment had\na greater effect on melatonin secretion and suppression,\nsupporting our hypothesis. Although the study protocol should\nbe discussed in various aspects, light-induced melatonin\ncontrol appears to be sufficiently effective even for a\nrepresentative day in an HCL environment. The HC-LED,\nwhich is expected to improve the circadian rhythm by\ncontrolling the wavelength band of light directly related to\nmelatonin, will be a useful item for maintaining a healthy\ncircadian rhythm in modern life, where people spend more\ntime indoors.\nAuthor Contributions\nThe manuscript was written through contributions of all\nauthors.

Although circadian rhythm dysregulation\nduring brain development was suggested to be causative of ASD\n[18, 30,31], it must be highlighted that also healthy subjects present\nsleep disturbances and related behavioral problems [20, 32-34].\nBesides the increased bulk of studies that have evaluated several\naspects of ASD etiology, it has been remarkable the understanding\nof the multifactorial association between several aspects of circadian\nmisalignment and the clinical manifestations of ASD. Here\nwe present mechanisms involved in the disruption of circadian\nrhythms by covering the basic mechanism of normal organization\nof the circadian timing system and its close association between\nneuroendocrine and neurobehavioral functions. Finally, we included\nour current working hypothesis which suggests that at least\npart of the behavioral symptoms in ASD is caused by an inflammatory\nstate linked to the disruption of melatonin production. Moreover,\nthese mechanisms are underneath sleep and cognitive disorders\ntypical of ASD.\n2. ORGANIZATION OF THE CIRCADIAN TIMING SYSTEM\nThe circadian rhythm in mammals is driven by the central clock\nlocated in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.\nThese important nuclei in the brain adjust the timing of several\naspects of the physiology to the daily environmental lighting by\nperceiving the light in the retina and integration of this information\nto the master clock, the SCN [35]. A neuroendocrine connection\nbetween SCN and the whole body involves the early morning peak\nof cortisol and the nocturnal peak of melatonin. The high relevance\nof this system for human settings relies on the premise that the circadian\ntiming system allows the body to anticipate and prepare for\nchanges that occur in the natural environment, thus improving its\nphysiological strength to orchestrate behavior and physiological\nfunctions to the oscillation of light in the environment [36, 37].\nThe oscillatory machinery of the SCN is based on the transcriptional\nfeedback loops of coding genes and its proteins [35, 38].\nTranscriptional feedback involves at least eleven genes [38].\nBriefly, the heterodimer Bmal1: Clock rhythmically assembled by\nthe circadian transcription of Bmal1 (also known as ARNT) leads to\nthe transcription of the repressor genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2.\nThe proteins translated from these genes form homo- or heterodimers\nthat suppress Bmal1: Clock activity. Such transcription/\ntranslation rates repeat over an approximately 24-hour period\n(circadian, from the Latin, around one day) [35, 39]. The robust\ncircadian endogenous rhythm of the SCN is transmitted to the\nwhole body by neural and hormonal connections, synchronizing\ncells, tissues, and functions.\nLight input to the SCN is mediated by the direct retinohypothalamic\ntract, which initiates in the photoreceptive ganglion cells\nin the retina [40]. Also, non-photic signals, including molecular\nchanges typical of some pathologies, may influence the SCN and\nconsequently alter the biological rhythms [41-43]. Thus, the synchrony\nof the SCN to light is mediated by specific cells of the retina\nthat project to the SCN and other thalamic areas [44]. Environmental\nlight is the major zeitgeber for the SCN, however, activity,\ntemperature, and social interaction are relevant secondary time\ngivers [39, 43, 45].\nFor the orchestration of typical circadian rhythmic behaviors,\nthe connections from the SCN to other areas are established primarily\nthrough a relay in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus\n(PVN), an important neuroanatomic link for inducing neuroendocrine\nresponses, with implications for biological rhythms, metabolism,\nimmune system, autonomic nervous system and emotional\nbehavior control [44, 46] (Fig. 1).\nThus, SCN orchestrates many complex \u2018timed\u2019 internal systems,\nsuch as body temperature, endocrine functions, and blood\npressure. The rhythmic clock gene expression within the SCN is\ntranslated to multiple brain regions and control mood and motivational\nbehaviors, stress reward circuits, arousal, and sleep by interacting\nwith the homeostatic regulation of sleep and wake patterns\n[47]. As master brain oscillator, it must act in synchronicity to the\nperipheral oscillatory system, which is well known to co-exist under\na hierarchical control from the SCN. Otherwise, the conflict\nbetween the SCN-driven rhythms to peripheral oscillators can reset\nseveral physiological functions by many parallel signals [48, 49].\nThus, the circadian timing of the organism is a complex system\nsubject to different grades of misfits.\nAbnormal circadian rhythms were shown to increase the risk\nfor, as well as the severity of ASD [14, 30]. Desynchronization of\nhormone secretion, thermoregulation, locomotor activity, and sleep\nwas associated with early alterations in the development of autistic\nchildren\u00b4s brains [17, 26, 50-52].\nThe lack of control in the timing of brain development due to\nabnormalities in clock gene machinery was correlated with behavioral\nchanges [53]. Indeed, the involvement of clock genes in ASD\nhas been described [54]. Significant allelic association of polymorphisms\nin PER1 and Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) and\nASD [16], SNPs in the coding region of Nuclear Receptor subfamily\n1, group D, member 1 (NR1D1) a gene coding for the control of\ntranscription of Bmal1 gene [55] as well as mutations/SNPs in\nCLOCK and in NR1D1 and ARNT2 that encode proteins linked to\nsleep disorders were described [56]. The relationship between a\nmutation in clock gene machinery and circadian-related genes and\nsleep is also an important subject in ASD [57-59], as it was shown\nto result in cognitive, attentional, and psychiatric disorders [20, 60].\n3. MELATONIN: JUST THE HORMONE OF DARKNESS?\nThe \u2018chemical signal of darkness\u2019, melatonin, was first discovered\nand isolated from the bovine pineal gland extracts in 1958 by\nAaron Lerner studies of pigment aggregation in frog skin melanophores\n[62]. Subsequently to its discovery, melatonin\u2019s action in\nreproductive function was readily proposed. Later on, several researchers\nconfirmed this indoleamine as a neuroendocrine factor\nsecreted by the pineal gland in a variety of species under the synchrony\nof the environmental lighting and under the strict control of\nthe SCN [63]. Recently, several studies demonstrated that finetuning\nthe nocturnal synthesis of melatonin may also integrate external\nlighting to endogenous homeostasis, as the pineal gland, a\ncircumventricular organ, also senses endogenous molecules, including\nglucocorticoids and inflammatory mediators, which may have\nconsequences for health and disease [64].\nThe neural integration from the SCN for allowing the synthesis\nof melatonin by the pineal gland involves a multi-synaptic pathway\nthat links the SCN, PVN, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG),\nwhere sympathetic postganglionic axons emerge to the gland\nthrough the pineal stalk releasing norepinephrine at the dark phase,\nactivating the synthesis of melatonin [65]. The PVN is an important\nrelay for SCN-controlling melatonin synthesis as its lesion abolishes\nthe nocturnal rise in melatonin production [66].\nFor the rhythmic production of cortisol, the SCN acts through\ntwo pathways: the first, by a neuroendocrine response, which consists\nof the action of the PVN on the adenohypophysis inducing the\nsecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) that via systemic\ncirculation acts on the adrenal gland cortex. The other pathway\noccurs via the neural pathway, where PVN stimulatory neurotransmission,\nvia the spinal cord mid-spinal column, induces the synthesis\nof cortisol [67].", "metadata": {"name": "Dysregulation of Circadian Rhythms in Autism Spectrum Disorders", "page": 2, "pdf_id": "4a98b445-1f09-4a39-8425-dd23b7140e64"}, "id": "12"}, {"document": "accomplished via rhythmic expression of genes encoding regulators and enzymes\nof important metabolic pathways. The core components of the circadian clock\nnetwork include transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1, which heterodimerize\nand bind to the E-box motifs on clock-controlled genes (CCGs) to drive their\ntranscription. Two such CCGs include PER and CRY genes which, when activated\nthroughout the day, cause accumulation of PER and CRY proteins by the night and\nform heterotypic complexes with additional proteins [6]. These complexes associate\nwith CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers and repress their transcription activation\npotential. The autorepression of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 genes by their own PER/CRY\nproteins leads to a decrease in accumulation of these proteins, eventually allowing a\nnew cycle of Per1/2 and Cry1/2 transcription to occur [6].\nSimilarly, another feedback loop of the clock system involves proteins\nREV-ERB, whose levels increase during the day and bind ROR-REVERB-response\nelements (RREs) within Bmal1 promoter, thus inhibiting Bmal1 transcription. At\nnight, REV-ERB\u03b1 protein amounts are low, allowing Bmal1 transcription to rise.\nThe repressive effects of REV-ERB are in constant competition with the retinoic\nacid related orphan receptors (RORs) (a, b, g), which also bind to RRE on Bmal1\npromoter to activate transcription [7, 8]. These transcriptional-translational regulatory\nloops operate in most tissues and control a notable fraction of the mammalian\ngenome, with many of them also being implicated in metabolic pathways [9\u201311].\nThis modulation of transcription and subsequent feedback based on protein\naccumulation allows the circadian system to fine-tune its regulation based on\ninternal and external factors. In addition to self-regulation via product accumulation,\nthe clock system can be affected by feeding timing and other stimuli.\n21.2.2 Local vs. Systemic Control\nEvery cell in an animal must adapt to the daily rhythm of food availability. At the\nsame time, metabolic homeostasis involves tight coordination among several metabolic\norgans and neuroendocrine tissues. Furthermore, this complex coordination\nfor energy homeostasis needs to be coupled to the organism\u2019s activity-rest cycle.\nThe circadian regulatory system functions to temporally coordinate these complex\nmechanisms. The circadian system in mammals has a hierarchical architecture,\nwith a central oscillator in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral\nclocks in almost all organs in the body. The SCN oscillator is entrained to the\nambient light to be in sync with the 24 h light/dark cycle [12]. The cell-autonomous\nmolecular circadian oscillator has nearly the same makeup in the SCN as well as in\nthe periphery, but cells in the SCN are coupled via synaptic and paracrine signals.\nCoupling among the individual SCN neurons constitute a robust oscillator and\nmakes it less susceptible to mild perturbations [13]. Peripheral oscillators do not\nappear to communicate with each other through tight local communications.\nRather, they rely on systemic signals for phase coherence. Indeed, in\nSCN-lesioned mice, peripheral tissues gradually become out of phase with the", "metadata": {"name": "Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases", "page": 3, "pdf_id": "0dfc0ca6-41c5-4a69-a201-6826b91ff714"}, "id": "41"}, {"document": "Figure 6.

The Duv values of nighttime HCLEDs\nranged from \u22120.0001 to 0.0011, which is a smaller range\nthan that of the daytime HC-LEDs. In terms of the M/P ratio,\nnighttime HC-LEDs had 13 to 26% lower values depending on\nthe CCT compared to c-LEDs due to the reduced intensity in\na wavelength region of 480 nm (Figure S2). In addition, the\nmelanopic DER values of the nighttime HC-LED were as low\nas 0.188 to 0.536 depending on the CCT. This means that the\nnonvisual effects caused by light are less compared to the c-\nLED having an identical CCT, and the nonvisual effects caused\nby light can be similar even if an HC-LED having a higher\nCCT is used. Meanwhile, the LF values were 79.7 to 127 lm\ndepending on the CCT under the identical driving condition\nas the daytime HC-LEDs. The LF was relatively low, especially\nfor the HC-LED with a low CCT of 1800 K, but this is a\nnatural consequence of the V(\u03bb) with a peak wavelength of 555\nnm and is acceptable for nocturnal circadian rhythm.\nConsequently, HC-LEDs with improved diurnal melatonin\nsuppression and nocturnal melatonin secretion effects\ncompared to c-LEDs were developed in consideration of\ncircadian rhythm without a perceived color difference.\nTo establish a healthy and regular circadian rhythm, blue\nlight exposure should increase during the daytime and decrease\nat nighttime. Various chip and phosphor technologies can be\nused in the creation of appropriate light for the daily cycle at\ndifferent wavelengths. As for daytime and nighttime HC-LEDs,\nwe confirmed that the indices representing the performance of\nmelatonin suppression and secretion were much higher than\nthose of c-LED lighting at the package level. To confirm that\nthis performance can be realized in real life conditions, a\nverification study of the HC-LED with controlled intensity in a\nwavelength region of 480 nm was conducted by monitoring\nmelatonin levels over time. Because two versions of the HCLEDs\nwere developed, one for daytime and another for\nnighttime, both versions were used during the 50 h human\nmelatonin validation study. Therefore, it can be assumed that\nparticipants placed in the HC-LED lighting environment will\nhave faster suppressed melatonin in the morning and more\nmelatonin secreted at nighttime. Although melatonin is not\nsecreted during daytime regardless of the presence or absence\nlight, it has been reported that using blue-enriched white light\nduring the daytime can improve workability by improving\nsubjective alertness and drowsiness.34,35\nTo evaluate the subjective drowsiness of the participants, we\nadministered the SSS self-questionnaires in the lighting\nenvironment. As shown in Figure 7, the first SSS evaluations\nin the c- and HC-LED lighting environments that were carried\nout 1 h after admission yielded results of 2.8 \u00b1 0.3 and 3.1 \u00b1\n0.2, respectively. The SSS scores at this point were considered\nto be the score for the habitual state of the participants as they\nwere hardly affected by the laboratory lighting. Meanwhile, the\nsecond SSS evaluations were performed 48 h after the first SSS\nevaluation, and values of 2.0 \u00b1 0.2 in the c-LED lighting\nenvironment and 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 in the HC-LED lighting\nenvironment were recorded. The second SSS score decreased\nsignificantly compared to the first SSS score (p = 0.004 in c-\nLED and p = 0.013 in HC-LED), which appears to be because\nall participants followed a defined study protocol. However, on\nthe third day of admission, the difference in the SSS scores\naccording to the lighting environment was not significant (p =\n0.492). This appears to be because subjective drowsiness was\nevaluated at the time of the questionnaire, and the results may\ndiffer if subjective drowsiness is evaluated at various time\npoints.\nTo evaluate the LED spectra effect on melatonin secretion,\n15 salivary samples were collected during a 50 h protocol.\nThere are three available methods for analyzing melatonin\nlevel: using blood, urine, or saliva.36 Blood can be sampled\nfrequently for analysis, regardless of sleep disturbance.\nHowever, its invasive nature and vein loss or collapse in\nsome participants are possible drawbacks of using blood\nsamples obtained via intravenous catheters. For these reasons,\nplasma sampling tends not to be strongly proposed for routine\nclinical studies. Therefore, in this study, salivary samples were\nused to analyze the melatonin level. Although salivary\nmelatonin is known to be one-third as accurate as plasma\nmelatonin, it is relatively simper to obtain and consistent.37 In\nthis study, the participants were instructed to go to sleep from\n0:00, but they had to provide saliva samples every hour until\n3:00. In other words, there were three sleep interruptions, and\nsample collection was not conducted after this time because\nthe sleep disturbances were expected to be severe. Their sleep\nwas partially disturbed, but nonetheless, under both c- and\nHC-LED lighting, the participants showed a well-developed\ncircadian rhythm that suppressed melatonin during the\ndaytime and increased secretion of melatonin at nighttime\n(Figure S3). Typically, melatonin level analyses are performed\nafter dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), when melatonin is\nabundantly secreted. However, in this study, because there was\nno dim light phase, it was not possible to confirm the exact\nDLMO, and thus, the melatonin analysis was performed\nassuming a time point after DLMO.

A list of genes and their implications on\ncircadian rhythm are summarized in Table 1.\nMolecular clock and its cellular\ndrivers: implications in\nneurobiology\nThe molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythms\nare relatively well understood. Circadian rhythmicity is\nregulated by a master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus\n(SCN) located in the hypothalamus. The SCN is the\nmain center that directs circadian rhythms in the body by\nregulating daily cycles of physiology and behavior.\nStudies linking SCN to the circadian rhythm were first\npublished as early as 1972. In this study, the primary and\naccessory optic tracts in rats with lesions in the SCN were\nnot sufficient to maintain the corticosterone rhythm\n(Moore and Eichler 1972). Damage in the SCNalso modified\nthe drinking and locomotory behavior of rats. This suggested\nthat the SCN may contain pacemakers crucial to\nmaintain normal circadian rhythms (Stephan and Zucker\n1972). Subsequently, the SCN was established as the\ncircadian oscillator in the brain, based on the fact that\ncircadian rhythmicity did not exist in any part of the brain\nwhen connections to the SCNwere cut using a Halasz knife\n(Inouye and Kawamura 1979). These and other landmark\nstudies indicated the ability of SCN to divulge rhythmicity\nto other parts of the brain (Weaver 1998). Neurotransmitters\nprofoundly influence the functioning of the SCN. For\nexample, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) expression in\nthe SCN was necessary for refining circadian output\nrhythmin mice (Ono et al. 2019). Circadian genes like PER2\nare expressed mainly in the SCN and other brain areas,\nincluding the midbrain and forebrain as well as the\nperipheral nervous system. Circadian rhythm-related\ngenes are differentially expressed in these brain regions,\nand their expression follows diurnal patterns (Staehle\net al. 2020). In addition to the SCN, there are numerous\nother cellular clocks in tissues across the body and the SCN\ncoordinates with these cellular clocks. The SCN executes\nthis coordination through circadian control of various\nsignals, such as autonomic, neuroendocrine, and behavioral\nthat entrain cellular clocks across diverse tissues\n(Mohawk et al. 2012). There are cell-autonomous clocks\ninside the brain. Circadian TTFLs in neurons and astrocytes\ncan drive molecular oscillations in the SCN and\ncircadian behavior in mice. The astrocytic clock regulates\nthe circadian function of SCN neurons via glutamatergic\nsignals and by regulating expression of clock genes\n(Brancaccio et al. 2019). Key clock genes have widespread\nexpression in the brain (Abraham et al. 2005) and have an\nessential role in many brain functions. BMAL1 is involved\nin hippocampal and astrocytic function (Jilg et al. 2010;\nMarpegan et al. 2011). BMAL1 deletion in mice led to impairments\nin learning and memory (Kondratova et al.\n2010).

Circadian\nderegulation has emerged as an important risk factor for metabolic disruption and\nrelated chronic diseases. Chronic diseases are on the rise worldwide, and emerging\nevidence points toward restoration of circadian rhythms as a propitious approach to\npreventing and improving prognosis of many chronic disorders. This review will\noutline the evidence supporting the importance of the circadian system in metabolism\nby debriefing the molecular basis for the interaction between circadian timing\nand metabolic health and behavioral, genetic, and human epidemiological studies\nindicating the health implications of chrono-disruption.\n21.1 Introduction\nMetabolic homeostasis is central to a healthy lifespan. Traditionally, homeostasis is\ndescribed as the property of a living system to establish and maintain a condition of\nequilibrium in its internal environment, even when faced with acute changes. As\nmost plants, animals, and microbes in this planet have evolved to adopt to the\npredictable changes in light, temperature, humidity, and food availability, mechanisms\nmaintaining metabolic homeostasis have also evolved to adapt to this diurnal\nchanges. Accordingly, a major function of the circadian clock is to anticipate the\ndaily cycle of nutrient intake and nutrient expenditure and maintain an internal\nequilibrium within a defined range of parameters. As a large number of metabolites\nand cellular contents are to be maintained at equilibrium in different organs, the\ncircadian oscillator makes intricate connection with homeostatic mechanisms in a\ntissue-specific manner. Disruption to this homeostasis of a given metabolite can", "metadata": {"name": "Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases", "page": 1, "pdf_id": "0dfc0ca6-41c5-4a69-a201-6826b91ff714"}, "id": "39"}, {"document": "external light-dark cycle and with circadian oscillations in other tissues [14]. Similarly,\nsynchronization is gradually lost in tissue explants and transiently synchronized\nfibroblasts [15, 16].\nThe SCN imparts temporal information to the peripheral clocks via systemic\ncues [14]. The peripheral oscillators are also sensitive to nutritional cues. In this\nway, circadian physiology gets modulated systemically from the central clock or\nlocally via tissue-specific clocks in response to local metabolites. The discrimination\nbetween these two routes has been seen in mouse liver, in a circadian\ntranscriptome analysis in mice with or without functional hepatocyte clocks\n[17, 18]. These studies have shown the liver circadian transcriptional rhythms are\npartly mediated by the cell-autonomous clock and \u201cdriven\u201d by systemic rhythmic\nsignals generated elsewhere in the body. Multiple systemic candidate signals have\nbeen suggested including steroid hormones and fluctuation in core body temperature\n[19]. In experiments relevant to circadian coordination of metabolism, daytime\nfeeding of naturally nocturnal rodent can shift the phase of circadian gene expression\nin the liver, regardless of lighting conditions, leaving the phase of cyclic gene\nexpression in the SCN unaffected. Thus, changes in feeding timing can uncouple\nperipheral oscillators from the central pacemaker [20\u201322].\nFeeding modulation of peripheral clock suggests that time of eating is a strong\nzeitgeber (entraining cue) for peripheral clocks and might even supersede the\nsynchronization cues received from the SCN clock. Under optimal conditions, the\nperiphery and SCN are synchronized: the SCN imposes feeding rhythms by driving\nrest-activity cycles using food-dependent zeitgebers in addition to other cyclic cues\n(like body temperature or blood-borne signals) to set the phase in the periphery.\nHowever, alteration of metabolism, whether through food content or feeding\ntiming, can lead to desynchronization of circadian clocks and a reciprocal disruption\nof metabolic pathways that seems to underlie the resulting adverse health\neffects to be termed as chrono-disruption. The mechanisms underlying this cross\ntalk between food consumption and clock-driven metabolic control are complex\n[23] and require further elucidation; essential components of this system are\ndiscussed in the sections to follow.\n21.3 Cross Talk: Molecular Basis of Circadian Oscillator-\nMetabolism Interface\nThere is extensive interplay between the clock system and metabolic inputs and\noutputs. Many clock target genes are directly involved in metabolic pathways,\nincluding lipid metabolism and the regulation of metabolic timing in peripheral\ntissues. One general example is the action of CLOCK/BMAL on the set PAR bZIP\nproteins DBP, HLF, and TEF, which causes these proteins to be transcribed with\nrobust circadian rhythms in the SCN and peripheral tissues such as the liver.\nPARbZIP proteins have been found to target various enzymes involved in major", "metadata": {"name": "Circadian Regulation of Metabolism in Health and Diseases", "page": 4, "pdf_id": "0dfc0ca6-41c5-4a69-a201-6826b91ff714"}, "id": "42"}, {"document": "Figure 4.

Chronic disruption of circadian rhythm\nin experimental animals or as commonly experienced among shift workers raises\nthe risk for many of these diseases.
